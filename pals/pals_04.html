</DIV>

<P>Bit of a difficult year for all of us, but as ever, looking forward to a better year in 05 :o)</P>

<P>Met <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/team_lunch.jpg">a bunch of new folk</A> on a trip to Morocco. Biking is the common theme, so looking forward to meeting up again in 05.</P>

<P>Did some biking with some <A HREF="../images/Pals/nev-boys.jpg">old friends</A> as well. Look forward to more in 05.</P>

<P>As 04 came to an end, <A HREF="../images/Pals/mike-oli.jpg">a few folk</A> came round for <A HREF="../images/Pals/beer.jpg">beers</A> to welcome Ian back to the UK.</P>

<P>There was a bikey theme to the weekend, but <A HREF="../images/Pals/bob.jpg">not everyone</A> felt up for it the next day. It will take a bit of effort, but we'll hopefully work the bike group back up to the <A HREF="../images/Pals/usa-bikers.jpg">numbers</A> in the US.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Pals/ian-pheng.jpg">Pheng</A> arrived just before Christmas and joined the rest of HQ in Wetherspoons on the last working Friday.</P>

<P>I'm looking forward to meeting up with <A HREF="../images/Pals/thomas-und-carmen.jpg">Thomas and Carmen</A> in their new place in Winterthur.</P>
