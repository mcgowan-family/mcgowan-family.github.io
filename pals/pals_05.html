<P><B>Autumn</B></P>
<P>Autumn has started with a <A HREF="../travel/california_2005.html">trip to California</A> with Fitz. All went well and met up with some new folk in San Francisco.</P>

<P><B>Summer</B></P>
<P> After the success of the UK Challenger event, most of the summer's focus was on biking and climbing. There was the regular biking during the week, the big <A HREF="../biking/morzine-05.html">Alps bike trip</A> with Crispin and the big <A HREF="../climbing/arolla-05.html">Alps climbing trip</A> with Leo, Julian and Steve.  There was a week up in <A HREF="../living_spaces/glasgow.html">Glasgow</A> in August where I caught up with Fitz to plan the California trip and obviously a lot of catchup wit the family</P>

<P>All of that didn't leave much time for other folk, but at the start of September, I finally managed to get up to Chesterfield to see Andy and Annie. We met up at <A HREF="../images/UK/chatsworth.jpg">Chatsworth</A> (which was excellent) and then did a bunch of running and walking the next day. Lots of quality pubs with great views, including <A HREF="../images/UK/crispins-boozer.jpg">this one</A>. Check out the name! Never having done much walking in the Peaks, I was well impressed with the place. If you get over there, don't miss <A HREF="../images/UK/uncle-geoffs.jpg">Uncle Geoff's Diner</A> in Over Haddon. He's stone deaf, so you need to write all the orders on notes for him. Definitely the sort of place you'd fit into your evening bike run if you lived in the area. The locals are very friendly and these <A HREF="../images/UK/peak-artists.jpg">wee girls</A> were raising money for Make Poverty History by flogging their artwork.</P>


<P><B>Jun</B></P>
<P> The <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">Challenger</A> stuff went from strength to strength and our close working as a team was the key to the win. We're likely to lose a couple of team members in the months ahead and we'll need to form a strategy for the Worlds in the light of that. </P>

<P>Steve passed another milestone this month and Rose laid on <A HREF="../images/Pals/steves-BBQ-05.jpg">a cracking BBQ</A> in their secret little garden to celebrate. <A HREF="../images/Pals/steves-BBQ-05-2.jpg">Nice chilled evening</A>, but a bit of a late start on Monday!</P>

<P><B>Apr - May</B></P>
<P> Met lots of new folk through Challenger. Lots of <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod2.jpg">training</A> and a few great nights out. Most recent was training weekend in Cambrian Mountains in Wales. There's no easy explanation for <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-andys-forked.jpg">some of these pictures</A>, and it's not always clear what <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-scary-garan.jpg">the link</A> to Challenger is, but everyone seemed to be having <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-goes-postal.jpg">a good time</A> :o) And <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-road-trip.jpg">despite appearances</A>, it wasn't taken too seriously. Find out more about it on the <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">new page</A>.</P>


<P><B>Feb</B></P>
<P>Got down to Toby's in Little Venice. Top hospitality and top boozers in Maida Vale, but he's taking these spinning classes <A HREF="../images/Pals/toby-spins.jpg">way too seriously</A>. Met up with <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-tower.jpg">the Fishers</A> on the same trip. Great fun to see them all again and help them get the best out of their short trip to London. It was bloody cold in town, but we got around and checked out <A HREF="../images/Pals/st-pauls.jpg">St.Pauls</A>, <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-beef.jpg">The Tower</A>, <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-globe.jpg">the Globe</A> and <A HREF="../images/Pals/eye-feb-05.jpg">The Eye</A>. In what turned into a busy weekend, it was good to catch up with Lynne from the <A HREF="../travel/morocco_2004.html">Morocco bike trip</A>.</P>

<P>There's now a regular film thing happening. <I>Merchant of Venice</I> is the best of the bunch this month. Gimme a shout if you want details of when & where.</P>

<P>Back up in Glasgow towards end of month and, among other things, ended up spending time with Iain at his 40th (nice pirate look <A HREF="../images/Pals/iains-40.jpg">in the Buff</A>). Good to catch up with Dick Gorman and Fitz as well.</P>

<P><B>Jan</B></P>
<P>Years got off to a good start with plenty of biking, <A HREF="../skiing/aosta.html">skiing</A> and climbing already and it's only Jan!</P>

<P>Andy sorted out tix to go and see <A HREF="../images/Pals/glawster.jpg">Gloucester</A> playing Stade Francais in the last qualifier for the Heineken Cup. Unfortunately the <A HREF="../images/Pals/shedded.jpg">Shed's</A> expectation were not lived up to and the few <A HREF="../images/Pals/line-out.jpg">high points</A> that Gloucester had came to naught. I reckon we should go to the final in Edinburgh anyway :o)</P>
