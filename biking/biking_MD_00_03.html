<P>Most of the biking was done in and around the Patapsco State Park. All of it was fairly technical single-track. Mainly short runs no longer than 8 miles, but a couple of times we rode from one end of the park down into Baltimore - a distance of 35 miles - on what became known as the Tour de Patapsco.</P>
