<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Biking around UK in 04</H1>
</DIV>

<P>A few more incredible trips up into Wales, including one phenomenal snow fest in February. Best weekend on a bike.</P>

<P>Me and James did the 100 km Hell of the North Cotswolds. Great day out, with only the <A HREF="../images/Biking/james_honcs.jpg">one mechanical</A> adding to the fun.</P>

<P>When up in Glasgow for Dezmond's funeral, it seemed fittinng to get out and do stuff with as many of the family as possible. Me, Brian and both Michael's headed out towards Drymen, crossed <A HREF="../images/Biking/endrick.jpg">the Endrick</A>, then back up and over the Old Kilpatricks on a route that Brian had scouted out. It was a great day out on the bike for all of us and it was capped off by incredible views of a dozen Black Grouse displaying at a lek, while Short-eared Owls and Roe Deer kept them company.</P>

<P>Later in the week, <A HREF="../images/Biking/crawford.jpg">'the youngsters'</A> were good enough to drag me around some downhill circuits above Milngavie.</P>

<P>Did Glen Tress and Innerleithen at Peebles in August. Both fantastic. Black route may be best in UK, but Cawdon Bank is bigggest fun in country.
</P>

<P>Sponsored run for cancer charity in Glasgow in September with Mick, Michael, Caroline, Ruth and Graeme Obree! Much money raised and excellent day along urban trails. Many thanks to all for sponsor money.
</P>

<P>Great weekend out at Afan Argoed in late Oct. Did everything in wild weather and trashed some fairly expensive bike bits in the process. Everything now full of Welsh grit.</P>

<P>Back in Glasgow in early Nov. Michael led nice trail at Craigmaddie. </P>

<P>Big event in Morocco for a week in mid Nov. Not too tech, but <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/bikers.jpg">great group of riders</A> and whole African experience made it one of the best trips. <A HREF="../travel/morocco_2004.html">More detail </A>in travel section.</P>

<P>We welcomed <A HREF="../images/Pals/ian-crispin.jpg">Ian</A> back to the UK by getting together for a weekend in Cheltenham. On the Friday we went up onto Leckhampton Hill (one medical, one loss, a few offs) On Sat we followed that with a long loop out to Winchcombe then back to Cheltenham via Wittington and the antennaes. <A HREF="../images/Biking/winchcombe.jpg">Minor mechanicals</A> en route and some <A HREF="../images/Biking/cleeve2.jpg">very tired legs</A> after the Friday night.</P>

<P>Biking finished in 2004 with a couple of runs <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/Lennox-woods.jpg">around Milngavie</A> over Christmas. Headed up towards <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/Craigmaddie.jpg">Craigmaddie Moor</A>, but missed the Auld Wives Lifts. Did find the <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/Linn-falls.jpg">Linn Falls</A> and clambered in behind the curtain to catch the early morning <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/Linn-falls2.jpg">sunlight through the fall</A>.</P>
