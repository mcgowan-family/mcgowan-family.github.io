<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>A Loop of North Lancs & Yorkshire Dales, May 2025</H1>
</DIV>

    

<p>Building on the success of <a href="https://mcgowan-family.github.io/biking/north-moors-24.html">last October's trip</a> to the Yorkshire Dales, we were planning a similar outing for May this year. Once again, we were taking advantage of the Northern HQ in Whalley. Will had selected another route that would take us up through the Dales to Hawes and back</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>As last year, we set off from Whalley and headed north, along the western flank of Pendle Hill and on to Chatburn. But this year, rather than head north to Tosside, our route led north-east, through many fields and seldom ridden (or trodden) bridleways, until we emerged above the banks of the Ribble, across from a tiny hamlet called Nappa. The Ribble at this point was formerly much wider, including a couple of islands. That width, meant that this was the only point to ford the Ribble for many miles around. The ford had been in use since at least Roman times, but was long since abandoned as other routes opened up. A set of ageing stepping stones, in need of repair, was all that remained to indicate what was once a key line of communication in the region. So one year on, a pleasant second breakfast was replaced by less pleasant wet feet. But the weather had been dry for months and <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-01.jpeg">we were lucky to be able to ford the river at all</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>But 'second breakfast', or maybe 'first lunch', wasn't too far away. We continued north, until we reached the little village of Airton and the Town End Farm Shop and Cafe. As usual, Jo got there first, but she had saved us a table, which was great. We all enjoyed a nice lunch, after which Jo headed back south and we ploughed on north to Malham.</p>
    
<p>Malham was busier than ever, with cars and their occupants spilling out in every direction. So we pedalled on through and kept going to <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-02.jpeg">the steady climb up Gordale Scar</a>. To Dave's delight, this bit of tarmac is known as Smearbottom Lane!</p>
    
<p>The tarmac soon gave way to gravel, and what glorious gravel it was! This is <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-03.jpeg">the wonderful Mastiles Lane</a>. Truly remote and another line of communication that reaches back to the Romans and beyond. A Roman marching route, then a lane used by the Cistercians to drive their cattle to pasture, and then a droving route used by Scots bringing their cattle south to market. Mastiles Lane headed east over the high moor and dropped us back to tarmac at <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-04.jpeg">the picturesque settlement of Kilnsey</a>.</p>
    
<p>After Kilnsey, we kept on north to 'second lunch' at Kettlewell.</p>
    
<p>Work commitments had kept Crispin away from this expedition, but he was never far from our thoughts, as in <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-05.jpeg">this little village</a>, between Kettlewell and Kidstones Pass.</p>
    
<p>Kidstones was the first <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-06.jpeg">biggish climb of the day</a>. Dave had <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-07.jpeg">a wee lie down</a> at the top of it, gathering his strength, before we set off up <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-08.jpeg">this brute</a>. That climb would have been just about rideable, had they not very recently filled it with deep, loose, gravel stones. We managed to keep off to the side for a while, but as soon as we hit the loose stuff, we were off. But eventually it took us onto the top and High Lane, then down some very exhilarating descents to <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-09.jpeg">the beautiful Semerwater</a>.</p>
    
<p>We were nearing the end of the day, but there was one last brutal climb, up and over Crag Side Road, before we dropped down into Hawes and some <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-10.jpeg">well earned food, at the excellent White Hart Inn</a>.</p>
    
<p>We awoke to more glorious weather, enjoyed a hearty breakfast, then headed south out of Hawes on the West Cam Road. The West Cam Road is also the Pennine Way and we would spend much of the day on that wonderful trail. We were sharing the lanes this morning with green lane bikers, but everyone was courteous, although the Cam Road showed the affects of the motorbike traffic. We were also sharing the lanes with some older forms of transport, that <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-11.jpeg">looked on with curiosity</a> as we struggled up and past them :) This was a lovely climb, up through moors full of curlew and lapwing. In fact I'd never come across so many nesting curlew as on this weekend. The moors were also covered in cotton grass, <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-12.jpeg">straining in the stiff breeze</a>.</p>
    
<p>West Cam Road was the site of the first mechanical. At the highest point (600m) on the west flank of Dodd Fell Hill, Dave got a puncture in rear tyre. It was a tricky one, down on the side wall, but <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-13.jpeg">some skilled fettling later</a>, and we were back on our way.</p>
    
<p>We were shortly to join part of the route from last year, as the West Cam Road, <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-14.jpeg">joined the Cam High Road</a>. This was followed by the most glorious stretch of tarmac (yes, tarmac) in the North of England. The following wind helped, but I don't think I've come across a lovelier stretch of silky smoothe single track road, in a more wonderful setting (at least, south of the Border :))</p>
    
<p>We weren't on our old trail from last year for long. After a few miles, our old route bore off west to the RibbleHead, while our path today headed south, to Ling Gill and its <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-15.jpeg">wonderful old bridge</a>. Once again, this was a significant old trading route, specifically a pack horse route. It's signficance can be seen from <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-16.jpeg">the inscription from 1759</a>, still readable, that tells us that 'the bridge was repaired at the charter of the whole West Riding'. Ling Gill, the bridge and the pools around it, are a magical little spot.</p>
    
<p>The landcape all around was limestone upland. Looking over a wall, we spotted <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-17.jpeg">this amazing opening</a>, known as Calf Hole, where a stream plunged down into a deep pothole.</p>
    
<p>Our trail dropped gradually down and brought us once more to the Ribble, at a crossing known as <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-18.jpeg">the Far Moor Bridge</a>. My picture doesn't do it justice. In what was a very remote spot, this structure is the world's largest stress laminated arch. It was not only very functional, but also beautiful in its construction technique. Not sure why they went to quite this much effort here, but we certainly appreciated it. You can <a href="https://timberdevelopment.uk/case-studies/far-moor-bridge-far-moor-near-selside-yorkshire/">read more here</a>.</p>
    
<p>Once over the Ribble, we soon crossed below the Settle to Carlisle line and then began climbing up again, on the Pennine Way onto the limestone uplands just to the east of Ingleborough. It was a wonderful trail and this view <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-19.jpeg">looking east over Thieves Moss</a> from Sulber Gate gives a sense of it.</p>
    
<p>It was a wonderful descent down Long Lane, past Ingleborough Cave and through some very sketchy tunnels ('Riders dismount!') that took us to Clapham and the amazing Old Sawmill Cafe.This place would have been worth the ride on its own. A truly historic site, where electricity first came to this part of the world, powered by a hydroelectric turbine, still set in the mill, that had powered the blade and lit the homes of residents for almost a hundred years</p>
    
<p>From Clapham, we quickly crossed the A65 and then headed south into the Forest of Bowland. Our route climbed very steadily up Keasden Road, reaching the high point at Bowland Knotts. A very fast descent from there, took us past Stocks Resevoir (with a link back to last year and the old warden at Kincraig watching the Osprey nest on Loch Insh). A sharp turn left, took us into Gisburn Forest. A nice section of gravel, led onto an unexpectedly <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-20.jpeg">sporty bit of singletrack</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>But we couldn't come all this way, without dropping into our favourite cafe at Tosside, in the Old Vicarage Tearooms. It had been an amazing couple of days. Great weather, great landscapes, great trails and great company. You might say, <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-0525-21.jpeg">we had our cake and ate it</a>.</p>
