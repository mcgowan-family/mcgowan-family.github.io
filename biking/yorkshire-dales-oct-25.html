<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Back to the Yorkshire Dales, Oct 2025</H1>
</DIV>

    

<p>In what had become our annual cycle, it was time for the next gravel gang trip. Will and Jo were still up in Whalley, so in what would likely be our last trip up there for a while, me and Dave headed back north, through the teeth of Storm Amy, picked up Will in Whalley and then carried on north to Swaledale. Crispin was travelling, so would miss this one.</p>
    
    
<p>Will had identified <a href="https://www.dalesbikecentre.co.uk">the Dales Bike Centre,</a> near Reeth in Swaledale, as a place to base ourselves. THe fact that it was also a 'cakery' and we were staying in the 'cakery loft' certainly added to the attraction. It would also enable us to do shorter day trips, rather than the multi day affair, with possible tricky charging logistics.</p>
    
    
<p>Despite the forecast, the next day started brightly and, after getting some last route tips from Stu at the centre,  we headed west up Swaledale, crossing the lovely <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-01.jpeg">Ivelet Bridge</a> near Gunnerside and headed on to Keld. The weather arrived just as we approached Keld and by the time we arrived, we were dripping wet. There was the choice between the public hall and its self-service tea room or < a href="https://www.facebook.com/KeldGreenCafe/?locale=en_GB">the Green Cafe</a>. We went for the latter, which fortunately was open and were welcomed in to a lovely open fire in the cosy front room. The main memory of that stop, was the fire, the hearty Welsh rarebit and the very 90's approach to internet access. But our tradecraft overcame the barriers and we were soon online, checking out the next stage in our route.</p>
    
<p>After lunch, we headed out into a nicer set of weather and started back east up the steep wester flank of Kisdon Hill. It was an interesting section over the lovely short cropped green sward of an ancient bridleway. Once over the top, it was <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-02.jpeg">a lovely swoopy descent</a>, crossing the Pennine Way, before dropping down into Muker.</p>
    
<p>From Muker, we spotted a likely looking gravel route on the north side of the Swale. To reach it, we left Muker on a path marked unsuitable for bikes. We soon found out why as we navigated a series of unusual, narrow drystone wall stiles. These stiles are apparently unique to this part of the Dales, allowing pedestrians to pass, but not livestock, and <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-03.jpeg">with some difficulty,</a> bikes!</p>
    
<p>That last stile gave onto the Swale, tat we followed east for a short distance before reaching the lovely <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-04.jpeg">Ramps Holme bridge</a>. ALso narrow! We headed back east, along the northern falnk of Swaledale, until crossing to the south side at Gunnerside. </p>
    
<p>Swaledale is full of industrial and farming heritage, like <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-05.jpeg">this lime kiln</a>, half hidden in the wood, near the aptly named Crackpot. The name seems apt, as you would have to be one to try the climb that goes up behind it, onto the moor. But taht was our route, and as the weather closed in again, we found spme <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-06.jpeg">nice stream crossings</a>.</p>
    
<p>Once on top, the weather cleared in time to give some <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-07.jpeg">lovely views</a> down towards Reeth. And that would be our path, back to the Bike Centre <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-08.jpeg">and cake</a>! It has to be said, the cake was pretty special, especially the Pear & Ginger :)/p>
    
<p>Day two and the winds had strengthened from the west. So with some more route tweaks from Stu ("do it the other way around"), we headed back to Crackpot, pased the lovely < a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-09.jpeg">Reeth swing bridge</a>,  and back onto the high moors. The road over the top from Swaledale to Wensleydale is called Cross Tops and climbs to a high point just over 1600 feet.</p>
    
<p>The descent to Askrigg is fabulous. And once there, there is < a href="https://www.thebakewellaskrigg.com">another great cafe</a> :) After a hearty lunch, we climbed back up the way we had descended, and then followed the northern flank of Wensleydale east, over <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-10.jpeg">Disher Force</a> and on to the very impressive <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-11.jpeg">Castle Bolton</a>. </p>
    
<p>After a quick cafe stop, we climbed back over the high moor and back to Swaledale and the bike centre. There was more tea and cake, including some to go. And our departure coincided with thete excellent <a href="../images/Biking/swaledale-1025-12.jpeg">Reeth Brass Band</a> playing some numbers as part of their local PINKtober events. Nice job guys!</p>
