<p>For a number of reasons, it had been a long time since we had been on a bike trip. During the summer, we came up with the intent to rectify that, with a 'bike packing' trip around the wilder parts of mid Wales. Bike packing is like an off-road version of cycle touring.</p>
    
    
<p><a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-1.jpeg">We set off</a> in early October and headed towards our departure point of Rhyader.From there we headed up the Elan valley to <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-2.jpeg">the resevoirs</a>. Upstream of the resevoirs, it is mainly <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-3.jpeg">river crossings</a>. We stopped off for lunch at the mythical <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-4.jpeg">Strata Florida</a>. I was riding an electric for the first time, which was fantastic, until it ran out of battery!! that was 10 miles before we reached the wonderful <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-5.jpeg">Ty'n Cornel hostel</a>. What a place!! </p>
    
    
<p>Day two was a bit rough. We didn't know that <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-6.jpeg">at this point</a>. <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-7.jpeg">This picture</a> is taken at SN 953 606. No bike was ever intended to go to this place. And yet despite this, <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-8.jpeg">these simple souls</a> appear to be happy with their effort.</p>
