<P><B>August</B></P>

<P>Did first ever time trials this month. Quite enjoyed it :o)</P>

<P>Did the Glasgow Uni ride round west end for leuchaemia again this year with Michael. Fitz came too. Fitz also came along, joined by Brian and 'big' Michael, on the <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-06-1.jpg">Pedal for Scotland ride</A> at the end of the same week. It was a much easier ride than last year as we <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-06-2.jpg">pretty much coasted</A> from Glasgow to Edinburgh. <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-06-3.jpg">The wind was behind us</A> and most of the rain fell when we were in the tea stop at Avon Bridge scoffing gorgeous cakes :o) Need to perfect the dodgy <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-06-4.jpg">over the shoulder shot</A>.</P>

<P>Nice to put the Volvo to <A HREF="../images/Biking/nice-rack.jpg">good use</A> :o)</P>

<P><B>Early Summer</B></P>

<P>The Etape training kinda dominated this period, although there was a nice bit of mountain biking around the Cotswolds associated with <A HREF="../images/Biking/Julians-stag.jpg">Julian's stag do</A>.</P>

<P>All the training paid off when we took part in the <A HREF="etape-06.html">2006 Etape du Tour</A> and both successfully arrived in Alpe d'Huez :o)</P>

<P><B>May</B></P>

<P>Started Etape training in earnest over the late May bank Holiday, with a 70+ up to Stratford on Sunday and a 30 the next day. Felt keen enough to <A HREF="../images/Biking/bike-wash.jpg">wash the bikes</A>!</P>

<P>Clare Mews crew did the British Heart Foundation ride. <A HREF="../images/Biking/heart06.jpg">It was wet</A>.</P>

<P><B>Apr</B></P>

<P>April already and this is the first entry on the bike site. Outrageous!!! I have been a wee bit busy and a few med' repairs have kept me off the steed for a while. All that is set to change :o)</P>

<P>Quite a few of the Challenger mob now have bikes, which is  cool. Did the long route through Upper Coberley with Ali and came back down into Cheltenham just in time to catch the <A HREF="../images/Biking/lekky-light-apr06.jpg">evening light bursting over the route</A> we'd covered. You get happy just looking at it.</P>

<P>Last weekend saw the HONC 06 take place out of Gretton. Our mob had a great presence this year. <A HREF="../images/Biking/honc-start-2006.jpg">Some of the starters</A> are in this group, but I reckon we must have known twice this number in the event overall. The route was similar to 2004 with the long start climb out of Winchcombe <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-strip-06.jpg">taking its toll</A>. We kept <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-lunch-06.jpg">a reasonable core</A> together right through the ride. And some <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-booth-fuel-06.jpg">late starters</A> finally joined the pack. Looking <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-booth-bliss-06.jpg">this happy</A> in that helmet is a gift denied the masses.</P>
