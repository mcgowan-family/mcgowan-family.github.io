<P>2005 saw the first Alpine MTB outing. Poor old James was such a part in setting it up, but work restrictions stopped him travelling. Our thoughts were with him for the first 4 or 5 minutes, then we got on with enjoying ourselves ;o)</P>

<P>Style of trip was more like a chalet ski trip. We were in Chalet Berger in Morzine, hosted by Endless Rides. The whole chalet experience couldn't have been better and the broad humour of the Barrow Boys was a welcome difference to normal chalet fare.</P>

<P>We were guided for most days. Nigel was a downhill Kiwi - hence his ability to converse with <A HREF="../images/Biking/Nigels-bird.jpg">the ladies</A>.</P>

<P>Initial concerns that it was all going to be a bit on the serious side were alayed when they took us for some <A HREF="../images/Biking/roofer.jpg">skills practice</A>. Crispin started out on the rigid, but as the week went on and his bones gradually crumbled, he switched onto <A HREF="../images/Biking/bad-boy-crispin.jpg">a bigger bike</A> and quickly <A HREF="../images/Biking/crispin-cruisin.jpg">got the hang of it</A>.</P>

<P>Weather and scenery were awesome in equal measure. I did a long day ride out to Chatel - watch out for those lift closures! Gorgeous mountains soared in every direction. The <A HREF="../images/Biking/dents-du-midi.jpg">Dents du Midi </A>were a particular eye catcher.</P>

<P>The hills were pretty busy during the day with walkers, bikers and paragliders. But if you stayed out that little bit longer, it was just you and<A HREF="../images/Biking/shepherd-chesery.jpg"> the shepherd</A>.</P>

<P>As the week went on, the style of rides morphed into technical cross-country. With the emphasis on medium climbs and <A HREF="../images/Biking/paul-blur.jpg">big descents</A>. There were a few injuries, but nothing serious (Jez and Dave may beg to differ). The climb of the Col de Cou was a cracker (I'll try not to dab next time!), and the descent was headed out by <A HREF="../images/Biking/paul-and-dan.jpg">Dan</A> on the <A HREF="../images/Biking/Patriot66.jpg">Patriot 66</A>.</P>

<P>Before we headed out, I had thought that more of it would be winding singletrack through alpine meadows. A week of that, could have been a bit much, but it was nice to <A HREF="../images/Biking/paul-in-flowers.jpg">get a few bits in</A> now and then.</P>

<P>We met a hell of a lot of <A HREF="../images/Biking/feed-the-bear.jpg">great bikers</A> and we'll definitely hook up again for some rides in Scotland and Wales. Bar Buddha will notice a dip in profits in August. Can't say my French improved a whole lot during the week, but we certainly all know what Plat du Jour is now - right Dave!</P>
