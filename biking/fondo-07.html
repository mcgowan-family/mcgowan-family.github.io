<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Gran Fondo Campagnolo, June 2007</H1>
</DIV>

<P>This year's big Euro epic was to be the <A HREF="http://www.granfondocampagnolo.it/">Gran Fondo Campagnolo</A> over the weekend of 16/17 June.</P>

<P>Steve P had been there and done it many times, so we had <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-cow.jpg">a head start</A> on all the logistics of flights/car hire/accommodation. We stayed in the great little town of <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-primolano.jpg">Primolano</A> which the Fondo would pass through later that weekend. <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-mabel.jpg">Everyone agreed </A>that the accommodation was great.</P>

<P>The route was a massive 217km and 15 000 vertical feet. the Fondo web site has details, but you can see it clearly on <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-map.jpg">this map</A> as it leaves Feltre and swings out through Primolano, over the <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-mangene2.jpg">Passo Mangene</A>, along the Travignolo Valley, over the <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-dolomites.jpg">Passo di Rollo</A>, down into San Martino di Castrozza and then finally over the Passo Croce d'Aune, before finishing back in Feltre.</P>

<P>As ever, there was a fair bit of <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-fettlin.jpg">faffing</A>, but pretty soon the big day was on us.</P>

<P>We all did well, and <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-kitten.jpg">those not riding</A> were out on the course at various points <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-race.jpg">to cheer us on</A>.</P>

<P>After a bit of recovery time <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-lizard.jpg">in the sun</A>, we did some <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-mangene1.jpg">exploring</A> in the valley. We got to make some<A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-mabel-puppy.jpg"> new friends</A> in <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-belluno.jpg">Belluno</A>.</P>

<P>The countryside around Primolano has lots of recent interesting history. <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-fortress.jpg">This place</A> guarded the gateway between the one of the Italian principalities and the Austro-Hungarian empire.</P>

<P>We were only there for a weekend, but it really did seem much longer. Finally it was time to go, so we <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-fountain.jpg">packed up the bikes</A>, got in <A HREF="../images/Biking/fondo-07-walk.jpg">one last hike</A> in the foothills of the Dolomites and headed home.</P>

<P>Great trip and thanks to Steve for doing a lot of the organisation.</P>
