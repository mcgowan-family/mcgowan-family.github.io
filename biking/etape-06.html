<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Etape du Tour, July 2006</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Another summer, another Alp, <A HREF="../images/Biking/etape06-start1.jpg">same old Crispin</A> ;o) Well at least this time <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle1.jpg">Susan came too</A>.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.letapedutour.com/2006/us/index.htm">Etape du Tour</A> is the day each year during the mighty Tour de France, when the punters get to pit themselves against the hardest roads in the race. This years was a bonus, as it would finish on the fabulous Alpe d'Huez, site of many of the most dramatic moments in the Tour's history.</P>

<P>We drove over in the mighty X5, pitched up at Allamont on the Friday, sorted ourselves out with some dodgy hotel accommodation for the Sunday night (very handy though!) and settled in to watch the World Cup Final!</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Misc/zidane.jpg">What was he thinking!!!!</A></P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Biking/etape06-start2.jpg">A few other folk</A> showed up for the early start, and before you could whistle an ironic <I>Allez les Bleus</I>, 7 500 riders were spinning their shaved legs off towards the first climb up the Col d'Izoard.</P>

<P>We paced ourselves early on, as we'd heard all the stories of folk blowing up 60 miles into a 120 mile ride. We climbed strongly over Izoard and down to the second food stop at Briancon. The food stops were a complete zoo, with hundreds of riders desperately trying to convince the serving staff to hand them <I>that sandwich</I>! Imagine trying to get 12 pints in the worst boozer in Cheltenham on the last Friday before Christmas and you won't even be close.</P>

<P>After Izoard, it was a long, but more gentle climb, up to <A HREF="../images/Biking/lautaret.jpg">Col de Lautaret</A>.</P>

<P>Tired legs took us <A HREF="../images/Biking/bourg.jpg">down to Bourg</A> and it was comforting to know that after 120 miles and 10 000 feet of climbing, we only had Alpe d'Huez to go :o0</P>

<P>It's <A HREF="../images/Biking/alpe-dhuez.jpg">a long way up</A> the Alpe d'Huez.</P>

<P>I'm impressed that Crispin managed a smile as he <A HREF="../images/Biking/etape06-finish.jpg">crossed the line</A>. Nice jumper too ;o) We both agreed it was a great day out on the bike, and if any of you fancy it next year, we're keen :o)</P>

<P>By the Thursday we were ready to stretch the legs again, so we popped back up to the Lautaret, and then on up to <A HREF="../images/Biking/galibier1.jpg">Col de Galibier</A>! It was cool to be at <A HREF="../images/Biking/galibier2.jpg">another iconic col </A>and another one that the Tour would cross this year.</P>
