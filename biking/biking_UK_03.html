<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Biking around UK in 03</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Since getting back to the UK, I've done a couple of road rides in the Costwolds.</P>

<P>Did the Heart Foundation, <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/heart_foundation.jpg">Tour of the Cotswolds</A> bike tour. Not as exciting as Tour de Patapsco, but great atmosphere. As the new 'landlords' of the Bell Inn, we hosted the first beer on the traditional Donnington's Run. It covers about 80 miles and takes in each of the 16 <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/the_fox.jpg">Donnington pubs</A>, with <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/coach_and_horses.jpg">a beer in each</A> - "You'll ride it off", they said. Hmmmm.</P>

<P>Yan linked me up with his brother James, and we have done quite a few trips up to the Forest Enterprise sites in Wales (CyB, ByC, Cymbran etc). Excellent standard, but no pic's yet as all concentration goes on hanging onto the bars.</P>
