</DIV>

    

<p>As October rolled in, it was time for our next bike packing adventure. This was a nod to Dave and Will's birthdays. Will had selected the venue and route which would start from Will and Jo's <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-11.jpeg">new home in Whalley</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>We set off from Whalley and headed north through Clitheroe up to Tosside where we stopped for <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-01.jpeg">second breakfast</a>. For some reason the porridge rations hadn't been enough to last the morning :)</p>
    
    
<p>After 'second breakfast', we skirted the eastern flanks of the Forest of Bowland and then crossed the A65 before pressing on to Feizor and a lovely lunch stop at Elaine's Tea Rooms. This was a great little spot. After lunch we climbed up <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-02.jpeg">Kiln Hill Lane</a> surrounded by lovely limeston uplands.</p>
    
<p>It was glorious weather and there was a group doing hawking with a Harris Hawk. Once over the top, it was a fast descent <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-03.jpeg">down Feizor Nick</a> and on to Helwith Bridge.</p>
    
<p>From Helwith Bridge, our route turned north, steeply up a very rough track that led up onto <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-04.jpeg">the southern ridge of Pen-y-ghent</a>.</p>
    
<p>After a run in with a very stubborn bull, we kept north across some rough, boogy moorland (very reminsiscent of the Cambrian trip) that brought us to what must be <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-05.jpeg">one of the more remote little honesty tea rooms in the UK</a>. This was at the very top of Greenfield Beck, before it, and we, dropped down towards upper Wharfedale and Oughtershaw. From Oughtershaw, we climbed steeply up onto Dodd Fell Hill and then swung west onto the Pennine Way, before an amazing, fast decsent on gravel to Gearstones and then on to the Ribblehead Viaduct and our overnight stop at the Station Inn.</p>
    
<p>The Station Inn is a great little pub in a very remote spot. They had allocated us a lovely table in a window with a great view of the surrounding hills. The bunkhouse was basic, but we got a good enough nights sleep.</p>
    
<p>Next morning started with a quick loop under the amazing <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-06.jpeg">Ribblehead Viaduct</a>. Frome here the route led west through Chapel-le-dale and on to Ingleton. We kept west through Wennington until we reached Wray.</p>
    
<p>Between Chapel-le-Dale and Wray, our route had been on tarmac. But we now headed south up onto the most remote part of the route, directly across the Forest of Bowland on <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-09.jpeg">a wild, exposed piece of doubletrack gravel</a>. We were lucky with the weather here. This section would have been hard work had the weather been any worse. But in these conditions <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-10.jpeg">it was just perfect</a>.</p>
    
<p>The weather worsened as we dropped down off the moors, past memorials to Pendle witches and after a fast bit of gravel we rocked up in Slaidburn, and <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-07.jpeg">another great spot for lunch</a> :) We actually headed off without paying for this, but we sorted it out later. It would have been a real shame to leave <a href="../images/Biking/north-moors-1024-08.jpeg">such a nice place</a> out of pocket.</p>
    
<p>The weather got progressively worse after lunch, which made Jo's effort to come out and meet us all the more heroic. After another couple of hills and drops, we were back in Whalley. A quick shower and then back in the Tesla for the return trip to Cheltenham. Another fabulous bike trip with the Gravel Pack.</p>
