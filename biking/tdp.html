<DIV ALIGN="center"><B><H2>Tour de Patapsco</H2>
</B></DIV>


<B>Sykesville</B>

<P>Park at the small parking lot at the junction of the Sykesville Road (off the 32) and River Road. Set off down River Road. Watch for single-track dropping off the road to the left. If you climb up the hill and reach property on the left, you've missed the drop in.
</P>

<P>Follow the single-track along the south side of the Patapsco. After about 3.5 miles you will reach Henryton Road. Make a left onto the road, then after 50 yards turn right onto the obvious single track climbing into the woods on the south side of the river.
</P>

<P>More excellent single track will take you up and down after 1.5 miles to the lay by for McKeldin on the Marriotsville Road. This section of trail is very prone to snapping your chain, so take care .... Fletch.
</P>

<B>McKeldin</B>

<P>From Marriotsville you have 3 options, determined by time of year and general trail conditions.
</P>

<P>If it's Spring through Fall, drop into McKeldin proper and ride along any of the river or ridge trails on the north side of the Patapsco until you reach Woodstock Road. This is the preferred option.
</P>

<P>If the rivers are not cross-able for some reason, you have two options. 
</P>

<P>Stay on the south side of the river and either side the single track that starts off to the right of the railway just where the gas line markers cross the railway (orange & white) , this is the next best option. Again follow the trails to the Woodstock Road. You will reach it on the south side of the bridge.
</P>

<P>If time is pressing and you enjoy pain, ride the railway for 3 miles to the bridge at Woodstock Road. This is the worst option, you may want to pack painkillers.
</P>

<P>In the latter 2 cases, you will then cross the bridge and drop down onto the trail on the left side of the road, joining the single-track by the riverside that option 1 would bring you along on.
</P>

<P>Ride the single rack along the north side of the river until you pass gas line markers (orange & white). After a couple hundred yards, a fire road climbs back left up the hill. Take care not to snap a chain at this point ... Fletch. Follow it to the top and turn right along the fence. Follow the fence trail, going left at any branches. Come out on a power line and make a right then left to cross the power line and enter the woods on single track. Climb single track through woods and you reach some property. Stay high and follow fire roads along the ridge. There are options here and route finding is tricky, but panic not. If you come onto tarmac, make a right, then drop right onto a trail back to river. If you don't reach tarmac, but find yourself descending to the river, just go with it. Eventually, you come onto an old jeep trail that climbs up and down above the railroad. Watch out for photographers and pinch flats.
</P>

<P>Eventually you come down to the railroad by a bridge across a stream. Cross the railroad to the river side. Follow it down for 50 yards and single track appears on the right. Take this down to the Daniels Dam.
</P>

<P>It is 5 miles from Woodstock Road to the Daniels Dam.
</P>

<B>Daniels</B>

<P>At Daniels you can cross the railroad bridge or simply ride across the river. The second option is rarely available and great care should be employed to avoid falling on your arse. If you are very lucky there may be a lovely lady waiting by the Camels Cave trail bearing hot drinks and spare bikes.
</P>

<P>Drink the coffee and switch bikes if required.
</P>

<P>Get back on the railroad and ride the jeep track to the side of it for 1.5 miles south. You will cross Johnny Cake Road and pass under the 70.
</P>

<P>As soon as you pass under the 70, look out for orange marker tape on a telegraph pole on the right. Climb the scant trail up the slope to a power line clearing. Head south along the power line trail to the blue marked trail in the Hollofield section of the park. Follow this trail round to the left. It brings you onto the park road. Follow that under the 40, then loop round, out onto the 40 and cross the Patapsco on the 40 bridge. 
</P>

<P>It is 2.5 miles from the 70 to the 40.
</P>

<P>Immediately after crossing the bridge, hop the rails and drop down to the river. Take great care to avoid endos that could threaten your manhood. You will join a section of single track that follows along a disused canal bank. Ride this at speed, hopping as many obstacles as possible.
</P>

<P>After 1.5 miles you will come out onto tarmac at Oella.
</P>

<B>Ellicott City
</B>

<P>Ride the road for a mile downhill to Ellicott City at the trolley stop.
</P>

<P>More options. If you're short on time and fancy a pint, call it a day here and climb up main street to the BrewPub. Celebrate in style, ensuring hats are involved. This ride totals around 22 miles.
</P>

<P>If you fancy some more riding, climb the Number 9 trolley trail behind the Trolley Stop.
</P>

<P>Climb to the power line cutout and take the single track going up hill on the right. This will turn into a fire road. At the powerlines, make a left. This will bring you to another fire road and big power box. Go right onto the fire road. This will take you out at the Fraternal Police Lodge on Frederick Roda. Cross over onto River Road.
</P>

<P>After some old stone buildings on the right, look out for a gas line on the left. Go left on the gas line. Climb up and cross the power lines ...  again. Keep right behind the horse farm. Follow single track to the creek and climb up the other side. Make a left at the T junction. 
</P>

<P>Come out onto the horse farm. Make a right onto a fire road and follow the fence line. The trail fades but stay straight on. There will be a gas line at the edge of the line of hedges. Make a right onto this gas line. Stay right keeping woods on the right. This eventually takes you out on New Cut road.
</P>

<P>Cross New Cut and follow more single track, keeping left, until you emereg at Hill Top parking lot.
</P>

<P>Choose your route of choice to take you down into the <B>Avalon</B>.
</P>
