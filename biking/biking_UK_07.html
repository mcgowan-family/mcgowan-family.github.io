<P><B>July</B></P>

<P>Everyone went down to see <A HREF="tour-de-france-07.html">the Tour kick off in London</A> on 7 July.</P>


<P><B>June</B></P>

<P>Something like 15 of us headed over for the <A HREF="fondo-07.html">Gran Fondo Campagnolo</A> 2007!.</P>


<P><B>April</B></P>

<P>Did the <A HREF="flanders-07.html">sportif of the Tour of Flanders</A> over the Easter weekend. really excellent trip.</P>

<P>After a  lairy weekend up in Newcastle, followed by Leo's 30th, I did the HONC! No pic's, but it was best conditions I can remember. If anything, it was a bit too dry. We were running slicks again - probably over-inflated at 60 psi - and those rutted fields have an effect after 100km! </P>

<P><B>March</B></P>

<P>Been too busy to keep this up to date of late, but getting out loads.</P>

<P>Most recent outing was with <A HREF="../images/Biking/polaris-1-3.jpg">Steve Pierini</A> on the Spring Polaris event , that took place down in the Borders. HQ was at the excellent <A HREF="../images/Biking/traquair.jpg">Traquair House</A> and the route ranged from there, <A HREF="../images/Biking/polaris-1-2.jpg">across the hills</A> in and around the mountain bike centres at Glen Tress and Innerleithen, though most of it was outside of those centres on marked trails, like the Southern Uplands Way. <A HREF="../images/Biking/polaris-1-1.jpg">Michael</A> came down to see the start on Saturday and by the end of that day we were <A HREF="../images/Biking/polaris-1-4.jpg">camped up</A> over near Selkirk! Final results are on <A HREF="http://www.polarischallenge.com/">the Polaris website</A>.</P>

<P>Next event is Tour of Flanders this weekend!</P>
