<P><A HREF="http://www.letour.fr/">The Tour</A> (or as all the blurb kept calling it <I>the Turn</I>) came to London over the weekend of 7/8 July. Lots of folk from Cheltenham went down to see the Prologue on the Saturday. I was lucky enough to get some hospitality from <A HREF="http://www.csc.com/mms/cycling/en/">CSC</A> thanks to Neil Arthur and Richard Morgan of CSC. It was a great day.</P>

<P>While the main Chelt group ended up in Hyde Park, me and Neil were in Horse Gaurds Parade. We got close up to the start line. This is Thomas Voeckler <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-voeckler1.jpg">signing on</A> and <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-voeckler2.jpg">setting off</A>.<A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-rodriguez.jpg"> Fred Rodriguez</A> from Predictor-Lotto looks very determined.</P>

<P>Some of the CSC team took us round to the team bus and showed us the bikes. It's just as well I'm not a geek, or I might have gone into too much detail. Anyway, keeping it high level, check out <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-front-hub.jpg">this hub</A>!!! Everything had little, golf ball-like, dimples on it to reduce drag. $1500 for <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-chainring.jpg">the wheels</A>.</P>

<P>While we were there, Stuart O'Grady came back in with his back all ripped up from the crash. Very exciting. <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-frank-schlek.jpg">Frank Schleck</A> (who came third in Liege-Bastogne-Liege) was getting his bike ready while we were there. All the other teams were there, this is <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-tmobile.jpg">Axel Merckx</A> warming up with the other T Mobile guys.</P>

<P>We headed over to the finishing straight and I got some good pic's of riders coming into the home straight. This is <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-haussler.jpg">Heinrich Haussler</A> for Gerolsteiner. There had been loads of stuff about Bjarne Riis in the build up. He had fess'd to using EPO in his riding days and, as a result, had been moved to one side for this years tour. But he was still there in <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-riis.jpg">the background</A>. Anyone know who he's talking to?</P>

<P>So things started to hot up and the big names started rolling in:</P>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-mayo.jpg">Iban Mayo</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-kloden.jpg">Andreas Kloden</A></LI>

<P>So could one of the Brits make it the dream start to the Tour?</P>

<P>They all did well, cheered on by the crowd. Here's <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-miller.jpg">David Miller</A> coming home. And then <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-wiggins.jpg">Bradley Wiggins</A>.</P>

<A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-vini.jpg">Vino</A> was really going for it.

<P>But it was the reigning <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TT_World_Championships_2006">world road time trial champion</A> and CSC team member <A HREF="../images/Biking/tour07-cancellara.jpg">Fabian Cancellara</A> who put an amazing 13 second on everyone else, to finish the 8km in 8 minutes and 50 seconds. It turns out that was my predicted time, As ever, no money on it.</P>


<P>What a great day! The rest of the guys had had a good time as well and Sarah came and found me on Victoria Street and headed back to Cheltenham. How long will we need to wait till it comes back??? </P>
