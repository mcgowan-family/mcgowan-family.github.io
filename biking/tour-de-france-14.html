<P>For 2014, the Tour was going to start from Yorkshire, as an Homage to Bradley as the fist UK winner back in 2012. We decided at the last minute to try and find some accommodation and were lucky enough to stumble upon some fabulous 'pop up' National Trust camping at <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-07.jpg">East Riddlesden Hall</a> in Keighley.</P>


<P>We drove up on the Friday night, then made our way on Saturday morning with thousands of others to Shipton, where we would see the Caravan and the Peloton come through. <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-01.jpg">We got in position </a>on the Grassington Road, just after the Caravan went through. It was going to be <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-02.jpg">a long wait</a>. But it was all worth it, as the leaders came through, with Jens Voight in his last tour, in <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-03.jpg">a breakaway of three</a>.</P>

<P>Back in Shipton, <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-04.jpg">it was rammed!</a> In fact it was so busy, that some folk <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-05.jpg">took to the water</a>.</P>

<P>There were a load of other folk from Cheltenham up in Yorkshire as well. Paul Meyer and Steve Pieirini were out on the moors. Steve Cartwright and his Mum were at Silsden. Dave, Jules, Will and Jo were at Grassington. The latter group came dowm to Keighley on the Sunday to see the sprint stage, and <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-06.jpg">we all got to catch up.</a> And then we got to see <a href="../images/Biking/tour14-keighley.jpg">the Peleton</a> one more time :)</P>
