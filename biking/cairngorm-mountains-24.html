<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>A Loop of the Cairngorms, 2024</H1>
</DIV>

    

<p>Building on the success of <a href="https://mcgowan-family.github.io/biking/cambrian-mountains-23.html">the Cambrian trip last year</a>, and to mark a certain 60th anniversary, we set our sights high and headed North. We had landed on a loop of the Cairngorms, over 3 days and resting at Tomintoul, Blair Atholl and Aviemore.</p>
    
    
<p>We travelled in Dave's Tesla, which was interesting in its own right to see how that would work on a long trip (that comment will age badly). We stopped off overnight at Will & Jo's in Ramsbottom and arrived at Aviemore on the Friday afternoon. </p>
    
    
<p>The first leg went through the Abernethy Forest on <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-01.jpeg">wonderful singletrack</a>.The weather was perfect and <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-07.jpeg">the trails were firm.</a> The <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-02.jpeg">views south into the Cairngorms</a> opened up when the forest allowed. At a few spots, there were <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-03.jpeg">boggy reminders</a> of what it could have been like.</p>
    
<p>After the forest, we climbed up and through <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-04.jpeg">the narrow gap of Eag Mhor</a>. Will had a nasty fall here, but was able to ride on. We descended to the first of what would be many river crossings over the next three days, in this case, <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-08.jpeg">the Faesheallach Burn</a>.</p>
    
<p>The trail rose upwards across some wonderful high moor. This is on <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-05.jpeg">the shoulder of Tom an t-Suidhe Mhoir</a>, looking east towards Tomintoul. We knew we were getting close, when we saw <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-06.jpeg">the old sign to Tomintoul</a>. But the last miles were the hardest miles, with countless river crossings over the Burn of Brown. That sign has a lot to answer for!</p>
    
<p>Accommodation in Tomintoul was fine and the next morning was another blue sky day! This was the biggest day by far and it started with a lovely ride <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-16.jpeg">south down Glen Avon</a>. We rode deep into the heart of the Eastern cairngorms to <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-09.jpeg">the shores of Loch Builg</a> where we found a lovely Adder basking on the singletrack.</p>
    
<p>After our first 'hike a bike', the trail improved as it turned west up the glen of the River Gairn. Towards the head of that glen, and in one of the most remote spots of the trip, we came across what appeared to be some kind of <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-10.jpeg">luxurious, modern bothy</a>.It turned out to be a day hut, for the paying hunting parties on the estate, kitted out with champagne and soft rugs!</p>
    
<p>From the Gairn, a tough climb rose over <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-11.jpeg">the shoulder of Culardoch</a>. Much easier for me with the electric advantage! The descent from there towards Invercauld was astonishing. Dave was so overcome by it, that he had to have <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-12.jpeg">a wee lie down</a>. The views <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-13.jpeg">west over the Haugh of Mar</a>, with the castle and Mar Lodge in the distance were breathtaking.</p>
    
<p>Soon after, we were enjoying lunch in The Bothy in Braemar, a great spot. After lunch, we rode west towards the Linn of Dee, detouring through the Mar Lodge estate, where a wedding was underway; they seemed a little surprised by the uninvited guests. From the Linn of Dee, it was back on gravel and on to the wonderful new MBA bothy at <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-19.jpeg">the Red House</a>.</p>
    
<p>The trail then headed south, with warnings from other riders of the techical challenges of Glen Tilt. It certainly was challenging. <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-14.jpeg">Dave made the best of it</a>. Half way down, and the storms that had been forecast since Braemar, finally hit us, just as we were crossing <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-15.jpeg">the Falls of tarf</a>. The rain was on and off, and we made good progress down <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-17.jpeg">the tricky trail</a>.The rain had clearly been more severe in some locations and <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-18.jpeg">the waterfalls</a> in the final section above Blair Atholl were spectacular.</p>
    
<p>Our accommodaton in Blair Atholl at the Atholl Arms was as welcoming as it was well accomodated. Great bike storage, amazing breakfasts and friendly staff. Just remember to have your kippers al fresco and wait to be served your coffee!</p>
    
<p>On our last day, the route parallels the A9 to begin with on the old road, before turning north into the wilderness of <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-20.jpeg">the Dalnacardoch Forest</a>. A few miles up the trail, stands the lonely keepers house of Badnambiast. It was strange to find it here, with seemingly recent echoes of habitation, but <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-21.jpeg">a history of its last occupant</a> from many long years gone. <a href="https://holeousia.com/time-passes-listen/ruins/invernesshire/badnambiast/">A memory of Donald McTavish</a></p>
    
<p>The trail climbed steadily northwards, past Sronphadruig Lodge, now abandoned, and up on to the shoulder of An Dun, with more 'hike a bike'. Then a wonderful technical section of singletrack along the shores of Loch an Duin, where we stopped on this old wall, marking <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-24.jpeg">the border between Perthshire and Inverness-shire</a>.</p>
 
<p>Our final river crossing, was <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-22.jpeg">the Allt Loch an Duin</a>. There was a short, sharp climb on the other side, which put Daves's rear mech into his spokes. This turned out to be <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-23.jpeg">the best 'mechanical'</a> of the trip. Just after this, <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-27.jpeg">by the shores of Loch an t-Seilich</a>, we had the best wildlife moment of the trip, when an immature White-tailed Sea Eagle, lifted off from just below us and then flew around and settled on a little hill a few hundred meters away. Its huge yellow talons were shining out, as it put up with persistent mobbing by a couple of crows.</p>
    
<p>The route now led down Glen Tromie, past the small dam that to my amazement has a tunnel leading west all the way under the mountain to a small power station on Loch Cuaich on the A9! From Glen Tromie, we climbed up and over into Glen Feshie. Just time for <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-25.jpeg">one last team photo </a>and <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-26.jpeg">a quick swim</a>. About that swim ....</p>
    
<p>After the obligatory trip to A&E in Aviemore - what a great hospital now! - it was time to head back down the road. What an epic trip, I really don't know how to top that one. The weather was a massive enabler, the midges hadn't emerged and I was still reflecting on kippers in Blair Atholl. Thanks so much to the guys for great company on another <a href="../images/Biking/cairngorms-0524-28.jpeg">epic birthday bash</a>.</p>
