</DIV>

<P><B>December</B></P>
<P>Got up North at Christmas and did some great little trails. Snow fell silently late one night and, despite (or maybe because of!) the fact that some socialising had already started, me and Michael decided to go and bag the little secret trail up in Craigmaddie while it had fresh snow. It was clear that the snow would be melting by morning, so it was a one time shot. We made it all the way up there without lights due to the city glow reflecting off the snow and clouds, but once into the woods it was<A HREF="../images/Biking/michael-secret-snow-05.jpg"> lights on!</A> Sure enough, the secret trail was lying there, pristine. It was almost <A HREF="../images/Biking/secret-snow-05.jpg">too good to ride</A>. Almost :o)</P>

<P><B>August</B></P>
<P>Finally bagged the Killer Loop in one go. surprisingly it only took 4 hours to do it in one sesh. Hurt quite a bit in the last quarter, but you'd expect that at 36 miles  off-road and 1500 metres of climbing :o)</P>

<P>Got in another couple of <A HREF="../images/Biking/7stanes.jpg">7 Stanes</A> towards the end of the month. Did the main loop at Forest of Ae which is fabulous. Went on down to Mabie and did <A HREF="../images/Biking/mabie-dark-side.jpg">the Dark Side</A>. <A HREF="../images/Biking/mabie-warning.jpg">The warning</A> says it all really, but I couldn't help myself. XC Jay lords beware; there be dragons.</P>

<P>Finished off the month with the Pedal for Scotland ride from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Conditions were challenging, but <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-05.jpg">me and Michael</A> did it on MTBs in a respectable 4 hours.</P>

<P><B>July</B></P>
<P>Biking's really picked up this month. Finally figured out all of the Killer Loop in FoD. It's taken me two go's and a combined time of 7 hours, so it will be massive to do the whole thing. Found another <A HREF="../images/Biking/slow-worm-july05.jpg">slow worm</A> last weekend - great little nadgers.</P>

<P>Got out on Cleeve Hill last night with <A HREF="../images/Biking/cleeve-crispin&julian-0705.jpg">Crispin and Julian</A>. It was a blowy summer night, with some blustery showers, and we found some scary bum off the back end <A HREF="../images/Biking/cleeve-arsy-0705.jpg">descents</A> that we'd be happy to share with the rest of the crew.</P>

<P>Tried the whole Killer Loop last weekend. Aborted at half way point, so it's still out there as a prize. Most entertaining moment was me taking a 20 foot endo onto my head. Bike went a further 10 feet for a record breaking 30 foot yard sail. Now in treatment - physio, rather than psycho.</P>

<P>Great Tuesday night ride up and over Lekky that introduced newbie Dave into the mysteries of <A HREF="../images/Biking/lekky-mech-jul05.jpg">trail-side maintenance</A>. Weather was perfect as we literally rode <A HREF="../images/Biking/wistley-jul05.jpg">into the sunset</A>. Not sure if this sign was encouraging us to <A HREF="../images/Biking/free-ranging.jpg">eat organic</A> or not?</P>

<P>Finished off the month with amazing trip out to <A HREF="morzine-05.html">Morzine</A> in Haute-Savoie.</P>

<P><B>June</B></P>
<P>Not surprisingly, Challenger took centre stage to some of the biking this month, but we still got out now and then. Now that it's over, we're back on the routine - which means we always <A HREF="../images/Biking/red-hart-june05.jpg">aim to end up at a pub</A> :o)</P>

<P>We went down to the FoD on Saturday and explored the SW and SE quarters. Not a lot there from a biking perspective, but saw some <A HREF="../images/Biking/slow-worm-june05.jpg">decent wildlife</A> and some great bits of industrial heritage (including a working one-man coal mine!).</P>

<P><B>May</B></P>
<P>Pompino is already fun on the commute into work, but every run there are a few unexpected 'moments' as I get accustomed to the mystery of the fixed.</P>

<P>Another great Challenger day out in the FoD. Ian and Andy came along and made sure everyone had a good time. Once again we all got some air ...</P>

<P>In another part of the forest I got a bit too much air and then a very resounding return to earth. Bike's a bit beat up, but I got off with minor damage.</P>

<P><B>Late April</B></P>
<P>I finally succumb to the inevitability of getting a singlespeed. I've gone for an OnOne <A HREF="http://www.on-one.co.uk/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=115&MMN_position=131:131">Il Pompino</A>. I picked it up in Doncaster at end of the month. Alistair Gow at <A HREF="../images/Biking/wheelcraft.jpg">Wheelcraft</A> built me a fixed for it. No doubt it feels strange initially, but it is <A HREF="../images/Biking/onone.jpg">a great looking bike</A> :o)</P>

<P>Great Challenger day out in the FoD. Ian and Crispin came along to make sure we didn't lose anyone (cheers guys!). Chris made sure we <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod0.jpg">all got there on time</A>, the rental folk could tell not everyone had done this before, "<A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod1.jpg">This, is a bike</A>", but <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod2.jpg">we all stuck together</A>, we all got <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod3.jpg">some air</A> and we all got very, <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod4.jpg">very muddy</A> :o) </P>


<P><B>Early April</B></P>
<P>The lights are getting longer, so we pull the start time of the Tuesday evening rides forward to 6 and manage to complete the run without lights for the first time since Winter set in. Fletch Carter comes out for the first ride and we all discover the benefits of losing a bit of weight.</P>

<P>Second weekend of April and it's time to <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-05-faff.jpg">HONC till it Hurts</A>! Oli came across, so our team was Oli, Ian, James, Crispin and me. Mike Hill, Byron and Matt were there as well, so a good turn out for our dispersed group. The <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-05-start.jpg">mass start</A> of a thousand riders was a fabulous sight - but as usual, we managed to be as organised as a bag of spanners and rolled out of the start right at the back. This gave us the pleasure of ripping through the field and as we all <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-05-cleeve.jpg">climbed up onto Cleeve Hill </A>we came across Mike Hill and his team from Edge. Only Oli was racing and he put in a great time of 4'54" ending up in 17th place - very impressive.</P>

<P><B>Mid Mar</B></P>
<P>Highlight of the month by a long way was the opportunity to bike the Porcupine Rim in Moab - OHHH MY GOD!!! Met up with some guys from Boulder and Sydney and we formed <A HREF="../images/Biking/team-porc.jpg">a pretty tight team</A> climbing up to the Rim view over Castle Valley. Dan (Boulder) was lower than his normal altitude, so I was just hanging onto his wheel. Stewart (Sydney) was way above his normal altitude, so he was coughing up a lung. We rolled across the fast descent on top, rocking off big drops all the way. I was on a Yeti ASX and it just ate up the bumps. Like they say, <A HREF="../images/Biking/stewart-airs.jpg">to air is human</A>, to land is divine. After you go through the gate into the singletrack section proper, the seriousness and fun go up a level. <A HREF="../images/Biking/mc-canyon.jpg">1000 foot drop</A> into the Colorado off the back wheel as stones skip off the edge. Dan had some decent endos and we all got a few bumps and grazes, but no serious prangs. We dropped onto the river road (which was closed to traffic due to the half marathon) and it was congrats all round. Massive.</P>


<P>Biking most weekends in FoD. Really getting a sense of the trails down there and linking up the various downhill sections.</P>


<P><B>End Feb into Mar</B></P>
<P>Got down to the FoD last weekend in Mar. <A HREF="../images/Biking/fod-start-feb26.jpg">Ian's mate Huw</A> turned out for the first time and once more the bacon and egg baps were spectacular. Did a great night ride on March 1. <A HREF="../images/Biking/lekky-top-mar1.jpg">A good turnout</A> (with noticeable absences!) included Julian's mate Ian. There were an interesting number of <A HREF="../images/Biking/mech1-mar1.jpg">mechanicals</A> and Crispin and Julian tussled over the mech-man trophy. <A HREF="../images/Biking/mech2-mar1.jpg">Everyone pitched in</A> to get us back on the road. Conditions were interesting and everyone agreed that it was just as well we didn't follow <A HREF="../images/Biking/lekky-mud-mar05.jpg">the muddy route</A>.</P>

<P><B>Tue 22 Feb</B></P>
<P>As a result of being away every weekend, I'm now focussing on getting biking in on a Tuesday evening. We've had a few good groups out, but recent conditions have caused numbers to tail off :o) Conditions last night were spectacular! The ground was mainly hard and crisp, with a dusting of snow and the <A HREF="../images/Biking/lekky-night.jpg">views over the town</A> were great. The wheels were running fast through the ice and snow - could have been an icy night in Patapsco.</P>

<P><B>Sat 5 Feb</B></P>
<P><A HREF="../images/Climbing/rydall.jpg">Lake District riding</A>. Slipped in a quick afternoon in Grizedale Forest as a result of conditions not being up for <A HREF="../climbing/climbing.html">winter climbing</A>. Excellent day as a result of good advice from Paul at the Grizedale Vistor Centre. Forest trail ascent, singletrack and sheep track <A HREF="../images/Biking/coniston-feb05.jpg">across the top</A> and decent tech doubletrack back down into Grizedale.</P>

<P><B>Sun 30 Jan</B></P>
<P>The Forest of Dean looks set to become the local cross-country and downhill site of choice. We had a good turn-out including most of <A HREF="../images/Biking/fod-start-jan.jpg">the US mob</A>. As usual, Hawkins senior was in attendance and, as usual, he had <A HREF="../images/Biking/fodca-chain2.jpg">a mechanical</A>. After<A HREF="../images/Biking/fodca-chain.jpg"> repairs were made</A> a number of us, in a spirit of helpfulness, suggested that his rear mech may require adjustment. Ian's responses were difficult to make out, but I suspect he said 'Thanks for that tip lads'.</P>

<P>Rather than stop for a brew, we wanted to make the most of Matt's local knowledge, so pushed on for a bit of downhill sport. There's a lot of it out there, and we found some good descents that had Julian make the most spectacular off. Only Ian was there to see it, but his first thought was, 'This could kill him', so it must have been a good one :o)</P>

<P>We tried a few of the jumps. Pretty good sport, but we all agreed that we need to work on the technique.</P>

<IMG SRC="../images/Biking/up1.jpg" WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="400" alt=""><IMG SRC="../images/Biking/up2.jpg" WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="400" alt=""><IMG SRC="../images/Biking/away.jpg" WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="398" alt="">

<P>In a break from recent tradition, we found no chippy, but sampled the spectacular bacon and egg baps at Pedal Bikeaway. Top grub - Nigel Slater take note.</P>


<P><B>Sun 23 Jan</B></P>
<P>First road bike event of the year took place in <A HREF="../images/Biking/jan-snow-ji.jpg">glorious sunshine</A> and a fair amount of <A HREF="../images/Biking/snow-trees-p.jpg">snow and ice</A>! Conditions were gorgeous, if a litttle slippy under-wheel. There were a few unintentional offs, one of which unfortunately led to us losing James!  </P>

<P>In what is clearly becoming a pattern, me and Ian ended up in the <A HREF="../images/Biking/bourton-chippy.jpg">Bourton chippy</A>. As we are now set on finding as many as possible, we may as well review them. Ruardean still tops the league for hospitality, with Bourton coming mid-table. But Bourton did have chairs for tired legs.</P>


<P><B>Sat 15 Jan</B></P>
<P>Well we finally got out in 2005. Many thanks to James for arranging the event based on the mythical MBR killer loop around The Forest. Some of us had a fairly heavy night on the Friday, so there was great sympathy in the group for the head pain <A HREF="../images/Biking/mallards-pike.jpg">as we geared up</A>.</P>

<P>As is often the case, the MBR directions were shit, so we bailed after a few hours into <I>Jack's Chippy</I> in Ruardean, the Best Chip Shop in Britain (they made me write that) and entertained <A HREF="../images/Biking/chippy-girl.jpg">Chip Shop Girl</A> with tales of unrivalled map nav.</P>

<P>We look <A HREF="../images/Biking/chips!.jpg">happy enough</A>. That's coz it's peeing down outside and we're indoors drinking tea and eating chips. </P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Biking/wallace&gromit.jpg">Sponsored by Colgate</A>, powered by Amyl Nitrate.</P>

<P>We finally gave up on the MBR directions - did I say earlier how shit they were - and ploughed our own (very muddy) furrow. There were a few, barely planned, offs. <A HREF="../images/Biking/itsfucked.jpg">Hawkins Senior</A> had to retire fom the field after an off which saw him bail over the bars and render his steed unrideable. Now I know why it says Airborne on the frame.</P>

<I>Thanks to Ian for most of the pic's</I>
