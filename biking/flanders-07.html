<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Tour of Flanders, April 2007</H1>
</DIV>

<P>2007's Euro adventures got off to an earlier start than last year with a trip to take part in the sportif of the Tour of Flanders and then watch the main event the next day. It all happens over the Easter weekend. Excellent organisation by Don Muir from <A HREF="http://www.cc-cc.co.uk/Homepage.asp?">Cheltenham and County</A>.</P>

<P>We stayed in a great campsite at De Gavers near Geraardsbergen. Ideal location and accommodaton for a big mixed group. Near to good pubs and restaurants and handy for the start of the sportif at Ninove and various good points to watch the main event. Don't get pushy with the staff at the 'help desk' Tim. They don't have <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-02.jpg">a sense of humour</A>.</P>

<P>Steve and Louise were doing the mountain bike event and <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-01.jpg">the rest of us</A> were doing the road stage.</P>

<P>The road sportif has 3 levels: 75, 140 and 250 km. We all opted for the 140 km version which has most (16) of the 18 climbs in the pro race. Many of these are over the infamous pave or cobbled lanes. Dunno why I'm smiling in <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-03.jpg">this picture</A>. I reckon they should tarmac the lot of it.</P>

<P>The first climb is the Molenberg. This is <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-04.jpg">Dave A with the rest of the C&C guys giving chase</A>.</P>

<P>But like the man said, <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-05.jpg">it's not all about the bike</A>. I reckon you could make a nice week of staying at De Gavers. Loads going on, especially over Easter which the Belgians go nuts over.</P>

<P>The day after the sportif, we split up into a few groups to go and watch the pro race at various points along the course. Me and Sarah were on the <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-06.jpg">Muur Kepelmuur</A> with Dave and Clare and bumped into a nice girl called Rachel from the Cambridge cycling club.</P>

<P>The atmosphere was just amazing. The crowd were going crazy for hours. We saw Nicole Cooke come through in the lead of the ladies race and then <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-08.jpg">Alessandro Ballan</A> on his way to win the mens race. Fantastic stuff!</P>

<P>Allessandro did OK, but as Jiiim always said 'Look at what you could have won!!!'. <A HREF="../images/Biking/flanders-07-07.jpg">Dave looks well pleased</A> with his Ronde van Vlaanderen board game. </P>
