<P>Many of you will recognise the toast "Here's tae us, Wha's like us".
Mum really liked it, because it touched on the thing most central to her life; family. It seemed completely natural and was, for all our lives, just the way it was. She was always there, whenever any assistance was needed and always wanted to know how she could help, but never interfered if she wasn't needed.</P>

<P>This extended out to the wider family - driving down to Clydebank to see the Purcells, round to see Maggie Burns in Drumchapel and I'm sure she'd have loved to go and see Robert in Australia, but she never quite made that one. Another strong family connection, was of course her sister Dora. You can't count the trips across to the South Side or down to Dunoon. Later when grand kids started to appear, this added a special pleasure. Pictures of children started to cover every flat surface of 9 Clochbar and still do. I could just see an amazing happiness in her whenever any of the grandchildren were near.</P>

<P>Of course, her greatest family connection was Dad. To be honest, this wasn't that obvious once we got to the point where there were 6 kids bouncing round the house. Everything was wrapped up in the normal busy family life, but over the past few years, it's been a privilege to see what a great tenderness looks like 50 years on. Something for all of us to aim for.</P>

<P>The other side of her character that stands out, was her sense of fun. There was never a moody or downbeat moment. Life was always a positive experience and no obstacle could deter her commitment to making the most of daily opportunities.</P>

<P>When you look at the early pictures, there's always one person with a wider smile than all the rest, and that's our Mum. Crazy big grin and curly brown hair in every picture. In recent years, she'd calmed down a bit, but it didn't take much to get her going and we'll all recall many times over the years with her sitting there, tears coming down her face in laughter.</P>

<P>She loved an adventure ­ whether it was cycling round Ireland with Dora when they were both teenagers, going for a ride on the back of Brian's motorbike (which she fell off and then couldn't get up off the ground for laughing) or surprising us all by buying the first telly ­ and then being so excited when each of us came home and walked in, or taking us all off to the Trossachs in the back of the Morris Traveller. Every time she passed a boat, bike or flash car on holiday, she'd jump in or pose next to it to get her picture taken. She once went out to buy some pies and came back with a car!</P>

<P>We obviously all feel saddened by Mum's death. It was too sudden. But in some way, it feels like a natural course of things. Mum had had a long and very happy life. She had built a very loving family, had seen it bloom into a great set of grandchildren and had many, many friends. It was a long life and a good one and as she always said herself "I've been very lucky".</P>

<P>Her indominatable spirit won't be diminished by her leaving. Rather we'll cherish it all the more, by having so many memories of that enthusiastic zest for life.</P>

<P>When someone dies, they never really leave you. And if you go outside tonight and look up at the sky, look out for another extra star, another little star in heaven. Looking down on you, looking over you, looking out for you.</P>

<P>"Here's tae us,
Wha's like us,
Damn few and they're aw deid, 
Mair's the pity."</P>
