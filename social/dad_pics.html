<P>You could spend a long time looking through all the old pictures and I did. Here are a few</P>

<LI>Just <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-early0.jpg">6 years old</A> in Partick.</LI>

<LI>Looking like the film stars that he used to watch. I think this is in <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-early1.jpg">the late Thirties</A>.</LI>

<LI>He was a great one for the bike and travelled far and wide with his great mates the Cadzow brothers (Bobby and Johhny). During the early 40's, he found good success in competitive events, racing for <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-bobby-nightingales.jpg">the Glasgow Nightingales</A>. Of course, all this was done on a singlespeed bke :o)</LI>

<LI>He was in the Army during WW2, serving in the Army Medical Core as part of the 8th Army. He served in Europe as part of the Allied Invasion of Normandy and then after the end of WW2, he served for a few years in Egypt and Palestine, where <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-army2.jpg">this was taken</A>.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/dad-bundoran51.jpg">Full of the joys</A> at Bundoran.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dad-bundoran1.jpg">Now an item</A>, <A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dad-dancing.jpg">stepping out</A>.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dads-wedding2.jpg">Husband and wife</A>.</LI>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding-party.jpg">The Usual Suspects.</A></LI>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/family-early1.jpg">Everybody's there</A>. I'm the one in the middle.</LI>

<LI>Like Mum, Dad took huge pleasure from spending <A HREF="../images/Family/nutty-nieces2.jpg">time with the grandkids</A>.</LI>

<LI>Olive oil worked wonders on the hair, as this picture <A HREF="../images/Family/school-days1.jpg">without any applied</A> demonstrates :o)</LI>

<LI>Mum & Dad's later years together had some lovely holidays in various spots in <A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dad-malta1.jpg">the Med</A> and <A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dad-tenerife1.jpg">elsewhere</A>. <A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dad.jpg">This one</A> was Largs!</LI>

<LI>Dad really got into playing bowls in his later years. This <A HREF="../images/Family/dad91.jpg">team shot</A> of the Milngavie Club is from 1991.</LI>

<LI>This was <A HREF="../images/Family/aunts-uncles.jpg">a Christmas party</A> down at Erskine Hospital with Johnny.</LI>


<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/dad02.jpg">That step</A> won't seem the same to the residents of Clochbar Avenue without him perched there. <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-lawn.jpg">This shot</A> was from 2006.</LI>

<LI>Like Mum, Dad'll be missed at all<A HREF="../images/Family/tescos1.jpg"> their local haunts</A> :o)</LI>
