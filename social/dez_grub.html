<P>Dezmond was definitely good at this, but as with most things, he ploughed his own furrow. He worked as a cook in a number of places. The style changed throughout the years, but it was always memorable.</P>

<P><B>Insalata Caprese</B>; mozzarella, with tomatoes and basil to you and me. This appears on menus all the time now, but the first time I ever had it was in the workers lodge opposite the Clinic in WildStrasse. There was a great big bowl of basil growing in the window. and Dezmond would slice the cheese, lay on the tomatoes and basil, then drizzel olive oil and balsamic over the top.</P>

<P><B>The perfect pot of rice</B>; I confess I have no idea how he did this, but it always turned out good. Brown rice, cracked and just moist enough not to be dry or stodgy. If anyone knows how to do it, let me know.</P>

<P><B>Vesta curry</B>; just kiddin :o)</P>

<P><B>Iced coffee</B>; Take a teaspoon of instant coffe granules, add just enough boiling water to dissolve them. Stick it in the fridge. When cold, take it out and add a couple of drops of vanilla and some sugar to taste. Stir vigorously. Get some ice cubes in a bag and bash them to bits, maybe there are machines that do this now. Add cold milk and smashed ice. Stir and add straws. Best enjoyed on a really hot summers day.</P>

<P><B>Yulade cubes</B>; he definitely had the copyright on this one. Make Yuleade as per the instructions on the bottle. Rather than hiding bottle under bed to avoid siblings nicking it, pour some into cube trays and freeze. Critically, add cocktail sticks when mix is hard enough to keep them upright, but soft enough to allow them to be added. When frozen, remove from freezer and serve; or just eat them all yourself. [suitable for vegans and gluten free]</P>

<P><B>Pancha karma</B>; you've really got to want to do this. If you want to know what it is, check out <A HREF="http://www.ayur.com/dosha/pk.html">this link</A>.</P>


<P>Rack your brains and send me your favourites.</P>
