<P>When my Mum and Dad moved down to Dunoon, Desmond came down to give them a hand moving in. This was years ago.</P>

<P>Now I had a business moving furniture around - still do - so I knew how this sort of thing should be done. They had this one big wardrobe and there was no way it looked like it would go up the stairs.</P>

<P>We were all standing there looking at it and trying to figure out the best approach, but before we got very far, Desmond grabbed it, looked at me and said, "Think mind over matter, Ronald". Mind over matter, I'll never forget that.</P>

<P>Five minutes later, we had the thing going up the stairs. It was upside down and I had my hand under it trying to stop all the fancy bits getting broken off, but it was going up the stairs.</P>
