<h2>2021</h2>
    
<p>And for the frist time ever, they all get to go <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-moss-first-day-0921.jpeg">to the same school</a>!</p>

<p>Time for <a href="../images/Family/moss-6-0821-01.jpeg">a party under the trees</a>. Moss is 6</p>
    
<p>More local day outs. This time we are at <a href="../images/Family/pitt-rivers-0721-04.jpeg">Pitt Rivers</a> in Oxford.</p>
    
<p>Moss starts <a href="../images/Family/moss-day1-0421.jpg">at his new school</a>.</p>
    
<p>Still in Covid times, but good times are still to be found. Sarah thankfully <a href="../images/Family/sarahs-50-0221.jpg">celebrates her 50th</a>.</p>
    
<h2>2020</h2>

<p>We travelled <a href="../images/Family/botanic-gardens-0120-04.jpg">for Hogmanay</a>  as 2019 turned into 2020. We didn't realise how long it would be before we would see everyone again!</p>

    
<p>2020 turned out to be the year <a href="../images/Family/nhs-flags-0520.jpg">the world caught Covid</a>.</p>
    
<p>Me and Gerry went back and <a href="../images/Family/jamie-1020.jpg">caught up with Jamie</a> again. This is in Christian's house.</p>
    
<p>We all got off to Thomas Land for <a href="../images/Family/thomas-land-0820-01.jpg">Moss's 5th birthday</a>!</p>
    
<p>There was time for <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-04.jpg">one last trip to Thistledown</a>.</p>
    
<p>You never know what you'll find <a href="../images/Family/moss-autumn-1020.jpg">in the woods</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>We made teh best we could of day trips this year. This one was to <a href="../images/Family/tank-world-1220.jpg">Tank World at Bovington</a>. Patrick was VERY HAPPY :)</p>
    
<h2>2019</h2>

<p>As I always say, <a href="../images/Family/seesaw-0419.jpg">life's a balance</a>.</p>
    
<p>Peter passed away in March 2019 and everyone went <a href="../images/Family/funeral-0419-01.jpg">to the cathedral</a> to say goodbye.</p>

<p>Sarah almost died from cancer. But Moss was always on hand to provide <a href="../images/Family/comfort-0619.jpg">some comfort</a>.</p>
    
<p>Dave arrabged for everyone to go to Brize for <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-05.jpg">family day</a>, which of course Sarah loved :)</p>
    
<h2>2018</h2>


<p>Two new cousins joined the clan this year. <a href="../images/Family/cora-and-kids-0118.jpg">Cora</a> born to Ashleigh and Chris and <a href="../images/Family/latest-cuz-0718.jpg">Ayla</a> born to Michelle and Rob.</p>


<p>2018 followed the end of 2017 as a big snow year and we caught up with <a href="../images/Pals/patrick-dave-snow-0318.jpg">Dave and Jules</a> on the slopes. </p>

<p>Me and Gerry caught up with <a href="../images/Family/jamie-0318.jpg">Jamie in Trier</a>.</p>

<p>We had <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/summer-party-0518.jpg">a summer party</a> at the Old Rectory.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Pals/pips-christening-0618-2.jpg">Pippa got christened</a> and every dressed up in <a href="../images/Pals/pips-christening-0618-1.jpg">their best gear</a>.  And we had our <a href="../images/Pals/thistledown-0618-2.jpg">annual camp</a> trip to Thistledown.</p>

<h2>2017</h2>

<p>The <a href="../images/Family/metiviers-0417.jpg">Metiviers</a> came to visit in April.</p>
   
<p>Born <a href="../images/Family/tractor-0417.jpg">to ride</a>.</p>
    
<p>This was the year when I'd fnally sort out <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-5.jpg">Dezmond's bench</a>.</p>
    
<p>Another new cousin in the form of <a href="../images/Family/michael-fionn-0717.jpg">Fionn</a> :)</p>
    

<p>We all went camping down to <a href="../images/Family/camping-0717-1.jpg">St.Briavels</a> in the Forest.</p>
    
<p>This <a href="../images/Family/bikers-0817.jpeg">looks like trouble</a>!</p>
    

<p><a href="../images/Family/dennis-margaret-0817.jpg">Dennis and Margaret</a> came for a really lovely visit.</p>
    
<h2>2016</h2>

<p>Patrick and me were lucky enough to get off for <a href="../skiing/aosta-16.html">a weeks skiing at half term.</a> The girls stayed home with Moss this year, and <a href="../images/Family/mums-coping-feb-16.jpg">it all went swimmingly.</a></p>


<p>I got back from Italy and headed straight to Scotland the next morning for the <a href="../social/chris-ash-wedding.html">first of this years big two weddings</a>. </p>

<p>The big event in March was our <a href="../travel/scillies-2016.html">fantastic Easter trip to the Isles of Scillies</a>!!!</p>

<p>And then in the summer, it was time for the second big wedding for <a href="rob-shell-wedding.html">Rob and Michelle</a>.</p>

<p>There was another quick turnaround, as we came back fro the wedding in Scotland and headed off the next day <a href="../travel/greece-2016.html">to Greece</a>!</p>

<p><a href="../images/Family/westonbirt-5-1016.jpg">A lovely family picture</a> from the Autumn at Westonbirt.</p>

<h2>2015</h2>

<img src="../images/Lundy%202015/lundy.jpg" width="960" height="167" alt="Lundy in stone">

<p>We started the year with a fabulous <a href="../skiing/chamonix-15.html">ski trip out to the Chamonix Valley</a>. Hopefully the first of many :)</p>

<p>Later in the sping, we made good on our promise to spend <a href="../travel/lundy-may-2015.html">a week out on Lundy</a>. We'll certainly go back.</p>

<p>In July, we had a great expedition by open canoe down the Wye with <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-1.jpg">the Pierinis and some friends</a>.</p>

<p>Later in July, we <a href="../travel/shaldon-summer-2015.html">headed back to Shaldon</a>, which had taken over from Watchet as our Devon favourite.</p>

<p>So much of 2015 was taken up by the prep, arrival and aftermath of the latest member of the family. Jospesh Moss made his arrival <a href="../images/Family/jomo-stats-aug-15.jpg">at precisely 1045</a> on the morning of 14 August weighing in at a very healthy 9 lb 4 oz. <a href="../images/Family/night-before-jomo-aug-15.jpg">The night before</a>, sarah was certainly ready for the next stage. The moment of his arrival (the squeamish shouldn't open the link) <a href="../images/Family/jomo-first-moment-aug-15.jpg">was astonishing.</a> And Sarah was certainly feeling <a href="../images/Family/jomo-with-mum-and-dad-aug-15.jpg">it was all worthwhile</a> when we got to this point.</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 2015, we finally got to go to <a href="../travel/legoland-2015.html">Legoland</a>.</p>

<p>The next trip was at the end of October, when me and Patrick went doen to London with the Charlton Kings crew for a sleep over at <a href="../travel/london-oct-2015.html">the Natural History Museum</a>!!!</p>

<p><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/christmas-2015.jpg">Christmas 2015</a> was upon us. Nice <a href="../images/Pals/stilts-dec-15.jpg">days out to Slimbridge</a> with MT and the kids. <a href="../images/Family/christmas-picture-dec-15.jpg">Nice and relaxed </a>at home. We went to see <a href="../images/Family/christmas-concert-dec-15.jpg">Peter and the Wolf</a> at the Town Hall - a new tradition I think. The wooden tree from last year was on the gate in time for <a href="../images/Old-Rectory/christmas-candles-dec-15.jpg">Midnight Mass</a>. The table was <a href="../images/Family/tables-ready-dec-15.jpg">set in the dining room</a> for the first time since we moved in. And <a href="../images/Family/christmas-dinner-dec-15.jpg">Christmas dinner</a> was great. Grandpa had moved in upstairs by now and Grandma was just along the road by the Memorial.</p>


<h2>2014</h2>

<img src="../images/Family/peppa-1014-5.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Siezing the Cobra at Paulton's Park, summer 2014.">

<p>The bees started to earn their keep, and we <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/extracting-0714.jpg">extracted our first honey</a>!</p>

<p>We were <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/firepit-0814.jpg">settling into country life</a>.</p>

<p>We got some camping in. This is down in <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-1.jpg">the Woodchester Valley</a>, below Thistledown campsite. And later that summer went to <a href="../travel/watermouth-aug-2014.html">Ilfracombe</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick started into Year 2, initially at <a href="../images/Family/patrick-year2-0914.jpg">Charlton Kings Infants</a>. Bryher started into <a href="../images/Family/bryher-reception-0914-2.jpg">Reception at Leckhampton</a>.</p>

<p>Work continued on the house. We had scaffolding up for most of this year on <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/sarah-painting-0914.jpg">the west side</a>. And we made a good start into <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/alan-conservatory-1214.jpg">the conservatory</a>.</p>

<p>Birthdays for <a href="../images/Family/bryher5th-1014-2.jpg">Bryher</a> and <a href="../images/Family/patrick7th.jpg">Patrick</a> came and went, and then <a href="../images/Family/Christmas-Day-2014.jpg">it was Christmas</a>. <a href="../images/Family/michael&geraldine-1214.jpg">Michael, Geraldine, John-Ross and Erin</a> came to stay in between Christmas and New Year.</p>

<p>And the year ended up in Glasgow, <a href="../images/Family/cousins-1214.jpg">with family</a>.</p>



<h2>2013</h2>

<img src="../images/Old Rectory/sold.jpg" width="420" height="640" border="1" alt="We finally manage to buy The Rectory">

<p>The group of friends based around Charlton Kings Infants was a great little network. Patrick got on so well with his little mates. Here they are <a href="../images/Family/blue-class-bristol-0313.jpg">outside the aquarium</a> down in Bristol.</p>

<p>For the first time in many years, I got off skiing with Andrew. <a href="../skiing/champoluc-13.html">We went back to Champoluc</a> where cousin Brian was still doing his thing.</p>

<p>In April, after quite a stressful set of negotiations, we finally managed to buy <a href="../images/Family/rectory-0912.jpg">the Rectory,</a> that we had first seen the previous August. We didn't waste any time and stred <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/picnic3-may-13.jpg">making full use </a>of the space in the garden. And <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/wildlife2-may-13.jpg">we weren't the only ones</a> making full use of the garden.</p>

<p>We had our traditional late May first camp of the year trip. We went back to St.Davids again. As ever, mixed weather, but <a href="../travel/stdavids-may-2013.html">it was a lovely week</a>.</p>

<p>I took Patrick and his mates to <a href="../images/Pals/synagogue.jpg">the Cheltenham synagoge,</a>  to give them a little exposure to other faiths - and allow them to muck about in unusual headgear!</p>

<p>We had a lovely week down <a href="../images/Family/devon-1-0813.jpg">near Kingsbridge</a> in August. The weather was kind, we were <a href="../images/Family/devon-2-0813.jpg">on the beach</a> every day, except one when the heavens opened and <a href="../images/Family/devon-3-0813.jpg">we all got very wet</a>.</p>

<p>We moved into the Rectory in July. There was a lot to do just staying on top of the garden, but it was <a href="../images/Family/mowing-0913.jpg">all great fun</a>  and there was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-biking2013-1.jpg">so much room</a>!<a href="../images/Family/patrick-year1-0913.jpg">Patrick started school </a>proper, in year 1 at Charlton Kings Infant School. I started work on <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/treehouse-0913.jpg">the world's greatest treehouse</a>. As if we didn't have enough going on, we invested in<a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/bees-0913.jpg"> a couple of hives of bees</a>!</p>

<p>We started work on The Rectory, now The Old Rectory, in September of 2013. We took the front of the house apart first, replaced all the electrics and plumbing, did the attics, the cellar, all the floors and some decorating. All the while, we all camped out in the one back room. It was pretty tough, but we got back into the front of the house just before Christmas.</P>

<p>But everything got put on pause in October, when Patrick managed to pull a radiator over on himself. In retrospect, we were all very lucky as it could have been much worse, but <a href="../images/Family/baddy-1013.jpg">it was bad enough</a>. There was lots of care and attention, even from <a href="../images/Family/Wee%20P%20and%20Queen%20B%20Oct%2013.jpg">his little sister</a>.</p>


<p>But time heals everything, and that was true in this case. Getting <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/treehouse-1113.jpg">the tree house</a> ready felt even more important. And it was great to see <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-9-1213.jpg">Patrick up and about</a> by the time his birthday party with Oli came around in December.</p>




<h2>2012</h2>

<img src="../images/Family/chelt-river-walk-0512.jpg" width="420" height="640" border="1" alt="Sarah and Bryher above Dowdeswell Resevoir">

<p>We finally got an annual pass to the Cotswold Wildlife Park. And now<a href="../images/Pals/wildlife%20park%200112%201.jpg"> we seem  to live there</a>. The Watt Clan came along <a href="../images/Pals/wildlife%20park%200112%202.jpg">for the ride</a>. And <a href="../images/Pals/wildlife%20park%200112%203.jpg">everyone had a great time</a> as usual.</p>

<p>If you ever want to get a reaction from a toddler, stick <a href="../images/Family/bryher%20sundae%200112.jpg">a big firework in a big ice cream</a>!</p>

<p>Sarah's birthday presented the opportunity for Patrick and Bryher to help cook the cake. This consisted of <a href="../images/Family/sarahs%20birthday%200212%201.jpg">licking all the utensils clean</a> and then <a href="../images/Family/sarahs%20birthday%200212%202.jpg">the bowl</a>.</p>

<p>Some great weather in March gave us fun days for <a href="../images/Family/patrick-0312-01.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/bryher-0312-01.jpg">Bryher</a> in the garden, a trip to slimbridge to try <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0312-01.jpg">canoeing</a> for the first time and <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-01.jpg">a lovely Spring trip</a> to the Wildlife Park at Burford. Bryher looked cute <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-02.jpg">among the spring flowers</a>, <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-03.jpg">Patrick was never far away</a> and <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-04.jpg">you never know what you'll find</a> in that fountain.</p>

<p>We all headed down to Devon for what turned out to be a great week in <a href="../travel/devon-apr-2012.html">Bucks Mills</a>.</p>

<p>Before the rain arrived for the summer, we got some <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-reservoir-0412.jpg">nice walks</a> in. This was at <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-reservoir-0412-02.jpg">Dowdeswell Resevoir</a>.</P>

<p>Who would have thought we'd ever see <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bhoy-0512.jpg">this shirt</a> getting worn again. Not sure who it was bought for - Michael or Dezmond maybe?</p>

<p>You wouldn't <a href="../images/Family/bryher-grins-0512.jpg">mess with her</a>.</p>

<p>Another lovely walk, this time <a href="../images/Family/chelt-river-walk-0512.jpg">heading up the Chelt</a> above Dowdeswell.</p>

<p>We got into the Jubilee mood, with <a href="../travel/stdavids-jun-2012.html">a cracking trip to Pembroke</a> with all our mates.</p>

<p>Sarah got to  fulfill a wish and<a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0612-01.jpg"> look after the Tapirs </a>at the Wildlife Park. they share their space with the Capybaras and Maras; including old Charlie. <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0612-02.jpg">Looks like she enjoyed it </a>:)</p>

<p><a href="../climbing/bernese-oberland-12.html">Popped across to the Alps</a> for a short weekend in the hills with Dave's Asbridge  Forman.</p>

<p>The summer was filled with lots of friends, old and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-giles-0712.jpg">new</a>. And funfilled family days with <a href="../images/Family/patricks-nose-0612.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/bryher-wellyboot-0712.jpg">Bryher</a>.</p>

<p>And let's not forget <a href="../images/Family/olympics-0712.jpg">the Olympics</a>!</p>

<p>A lovely way to round off the summer, was another week back out in <a href="../travel/dinas-aug-2012.html">Pembrokeshire</a>, this time with the added bonus of a wedding!</p>


<p>It felt like the summer was rushing to an end, so just before it did and Patrick started school, we squeaked in <a href="../travel/ilfracombe-sep-2012.html">one more cheeky weekend at the beach</a>.</p>

<p>And then it seemed like the summer really was over as August ran into September. The weather turned cooler and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-reception-day1-03.jpg">our wee boy started school</a> on September 6th. He seemed <a href="../images/Family/patrick-reception-day1-01.jpg">pretty pleased with the uniform</a> and he still looks like <a href="../images/Family/patrick-reception-day1-02.jpg">our wee boy</a> here.</p>

<p>Out of the blue, Patrick announced that he wanted to be a dentist. <a href="../images/Family/dental-treatment-01.jpg">Early days.</a></p>

<p>Steve, Jas and Schwinny moved into Flagstaff at the beginning of September. <a href="../images/Family/pierini-bbq-0912.jpg">What a great place</a>.</p>


<h2>2011</h2>

<img src="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-05.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="1" alt="Bryher going with the flow at Slimbridge">

<br>
<li>Fun trip to the local pool to try out <a href="../images/Family/bryher-swims-0111.jpg">Bryher's new swimming cossie</a>.</li>
<li>After a few abortive attempts due to wild & wintry weather, we finally got up North in January to <a href="../images/Family/scottish-christmas-0111.jpg">catch up with the family</a>.</li>

<p>Patrick was beginning to get the hang of <a href="../images/Family/patrick%20scoots.jpg">his bike collection.</a></p>

<p>We took the van down to Weston in April, which seems a bit brave looking back on it. Despite al the ice cream on offer, Bryher decided to <a href="../images/Family/bryher-weston-0411.jpg">eat  the beach</a> instead.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Family/bonnie-bryher.jpg">What a cutie</a>. April 2011.</p>

<p>We get down to Slimbridge whenever we can. Both Patrick and Bryher love it. And <a href="../images/Family/patrick-spider.jpg">it isn't all about the birds</a>.</p>

<p>Easter 2011, was great fun. <a href="../images/Family/easter-11.jpg">Another year, another garden Egg Hunt.</a> Alex and Gess came over too.</p>

<p>We had a short break up in the Lake District in May 2011. A really lovely trip. Stayed ina slightly odd little village called Haverigg down on the coast. Took lots of little train rides and went out on <a href="../images/Family/coniston-0511.jpg">Consiton Water</a> on the steamer. Every picture has Patrick pulling a face.</p>

<p>We went to <a href="../travel/frigilliana-2011.html">Frigilliana</a> later in May for a week. What a treat!</p>

<p>We went  to see the Gifford Circus at Little Rissington with <a href="../images/Pals/gifford-0711-01.jpg">Graeme and Marie Therese and the kids</a>. It was brilliant! <a href="../images/Pals/gifford-0711-02.jpg">War & Peace</a> done through the medium of circus. Very funky. We'll definitely be going next year.</p>

<p>The van is such a part of what we do now. We headed down to a really nice local camp site near Stroud called Thistdown. Very eco-friendly. As ever, <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0711-01.jpg">we had a fire</a> :) But mostly, <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0711-02.jpg">we just mucked about </a>:)</p>

<p>Michael and Geraldine will be heading out to New Zealand at the end of the year. As an early nod to that, we had <a href="../travel/north-wales-2011.html">a bit of a lads weekend</a> in North Wales. </p>

<p>We rounded off our Summer in 2011, with a great couple of weeks travelling up to and around <a href="../travel/west-highlands-2011.html">the West Highlands</a> in the van.</p>


<p>Autumn was really nice this year, with lots of little day trips in good weather. This was at <a href="../images/Family/cotswold-wildlife-0811-01.jpg">the Cotswold Wildlife Park</a> where Patrick got <a href="../images/Family/cotswold-wildlife-0811-02.jpg">up close to the wildlife.</a></p>

<p>There was just time to get the <a href="../images/Family/soakaway1.jpg">crazy big DIY jobs</a> done before the weather turned. <a href="../images/Family/soakaway2.jpg">Bryher helped a lot</a>.</p>


<p>October had an amazing spell of warm weather, so it was back to Slimbridge and <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-01.jpg">Welly Boot Land</a>! <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-02.jpg">Look how strong I am!</a> <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-03.jpg">All happy smiles</a> for once. This was <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-04.jpg">Bryher's first exposure to the water fountain</a>. <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-05.jpg">She seems to have a gift for it</a>.</p>

<p>And then <a href="../images/Family/bryhers2-01.jpg">Bryher was 2</a>. <a href="../images/Family/bryhers2-02.jpg">All that cake</a> helped make up for being another year older.</p>

<H2>2009</H2>

<P>At the end of October, at 1636 on the 27th, <A HREF="../images/Family/bryher-1hour.jpg">baby Bryher</A> weighed in at 11 lb 1 oz. Very healthy :o) <A HREF="../images/Family/bryher-sarah-day1.jpg">Mother and baby</A> were very well. Dad was <A HREF="../images/Family/bryher-paul-day2.jpg">taking it all in</A>.</P>


<P>Patrick continues to be the first and last thing on our minds. He is mad as <A HREF="../images/Family/frogs.jpg">a box of frogs</A> and <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-bear.jpg">a wee blether to boot</A>, but <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-fossils.jpg">you've got to love him</A>.</P>

<P>As Spring turns into Summer, Sarah is really getting into <A HREF="../images/Family/sarah-gardens-09.jpg">her gardening</A>. Nice way to relax at the end of a busy day of work. We went and saw some slightly bigger gardens down in <A HREF="../travel/cornwall-2009.html">Cornwall</A> in the first week of <B>July</B>.</P>

<P><A HREF="patrick-christening.html">Patrick was christened</A> towards the end of May. Afterwards we all went to Zizzi's and he did <A HREF="../images/Family/zizzis.jpg">impersonations of Granda McGowan</A>.</P>


<P>In <B>May</B> we headed down to London and had a lovely weekend with Toby, Rachel and <A HREF="../images/Pals/william-bluebells.jpg">William</A>. We checked out <A HREF="../images/Pals/borough-bones.jpg">Borough Market</A>, then the<A HREF="../images/Pals/patrick-tunnnel.jpg"> Lady Diana memorial kids park</A> in Kensington Gardens, which is fantastic! Popped into <A HREF="../images/Pals/V&A.jpg">the V&A</A> for a spot of paddling! And spent Sunday in Kew. It was stunning and <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-william-blubells.jpg">Patrick and William</A> were very cute.</P>

<P>We  popped out to Pembroke for a weekend by the sea. Found <A HREF="../images/Family/barafundle1.jpg">Barafundle beach</A>, which is an amazing spot. Patrick got his <A HREF="../images/Family/barafundle2.jpg">first taste of a seaside holiday</A> - won't be his last <A HREF="../images/Family/barafundle3.jpg">if his Mum</A> has anything to do with it. Headed out to Skomer and checked out <A HREF="../images/UK/puffins.jpg">the Puffins</A>.</P>

<P>In <B>April</B>, <A HREF="../images/Family/michael-patrick.jpg">Michael</A> came down for the HONC. I think this is maybe the first time <A HREF="../images/Family/HONC-09.jpg">the Gales</A> have ridden the HONC.</P>

<P>Over the <B>Easter week</B>, we took Patrick to the Cotswold farm Park. <A HREF="../images/Family/easter1-09.jpg">He loved it</A>! We kind of enjoyed it too - <A HREF="../images/Family/easter2-09.jpg">Sarah in the petting zoo</A>! He'd never come across an Easter egg before, but he seemed to know what to do:</P>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/egg1.jpg">Very excited</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/egg2.jpg">I'll just have a bit</A></LI>
<LI>Maybe I should <A HREF="../images/Family/egg3.jpg">have the lot</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/egg4.jpg">Uncle Brian</A> taught me everything I know</LI>



<P>Did a <A HREF="../images/Pals/burns-09.jpg">Burn's Supper</A> again this year. Turned into quite a big event. Which doesn't explain <A HREF="../images/Pals/jo-banjo.jpg">this behaviour</A>.</P>


<P>We got <A HREF="../skiing/vallorcine-09.html">our fist ski trip</A> in to the <B>Chamonix Valley</B> in Feb 2009.</P>

<P>Cheltenham got it's <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/big-snow-09.jpg">heaviest snow</A> since the 80's during Feb 09. I <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/paul-lekky-09.jpg">went skiing</A> with <A HREF="../images/Pals/snow-dudes.jpg">Dave and Jules</A> on Lekky. Then <A HREF="../images/Family/shab-09.jpg">sledging with Sarah</A> on Shab Hill. And finally decided to <A HREF="../images/Pals/got-it.jpg">saw down a tree</A> or two - as you do. The tree felling was legendary. I was at the base, <A HREF="../images/Pals/yeah-got-it.jpg">Dave had the rope</A>, it all went <A HREF="../images/Pals/what-the.jpg">a bit sideways</A>, but <A HREF="../images/Pals/fuck-was-that.jpg">worked out fine</A> in the end!</P>

<P>The climbing and skiing continued into the early summer. Although that would be difficult to tell from <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-brolly-07.jpg">this picture</A>.</P>

<P>We had a another <A HREF="../images/Pals/june07-party.jpg">summer party</A> at the flat. <A HREF="../images/Pals/june07-party2.jpg">Who needs</A> a reason.</P>

<P><B>September</B></P>

<P><A HREF="dad.html">Dad</A> finally succumbed to the leukaemia on the 17th of September .</P>


<P><B>August</B></P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Family/geraldines-wedding2.jpg">Geraldine and Etienne</A> tied the knot on 25th August. Lots of French visitors came over to enjoy the festivities <A HREF="../images/Family/traction-avant.jpg">on Loch Lomond side</A>. <A HREF="../images/Family/geraldines-wedding4.jpg">Ross Priory</A> made a great setting. Everyone was <A HREF="../images/Family/geraldines-wedding1.jpg">looking very glam</A>. Some folk couldn't wait <A HREF="../images/Family/geraldines-wedding3.jpg">to tell the world</A>. I took the visitors round <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/art-gallery1.jpg">some of the sights</A> in Glasgow. We got some <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_06.html">excellent biking</A> in during the same week.</P>


<P><B>June</B></P>

<P>Finally got out to <A HREF="../travel/germany-2006.html">Germany</A> after 2 years. Ash came along as well and we all caught up on all that had happened and all that hadn't.</P>

<P><B>May</B></P>

<P>Couldn't resist going with Dave, Jules, Andy and Rachael to see the <A HREF="../living_spaces/cheese.html">cheese rolling</A> at Cooopers Hill.</P>


<P>Popped up to Glasgow for a long weekend. Timing was based on seeing the UK premiere of <A HREF="http://www.thecollectivefilm.com/roam/index_roam.html"><I>Roam</I></A>. Movie was excellent. Place was rammed with what seemed to be every biker in Glasgow. Me and <A HREF="../images/Family/michael_paul_frank.jpg">Michael</A> now feeling very inspired to go and pump up the tyres at least :o)</P> 

<P>Went shopping for dresses with Shell and Ashleigh!!! <A HREF="../images/Family/michelles-dress.jpg">This wasn't the one</A> Shell bought. All the excitement was draining, so we decamped to <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/gandolfis.jpg">Gandolfis</A> for gorgeous lunch.</P>

<P>Managed to make myself useful at Clochbar by laying some lawn. <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-lawn.jpg">The happy customer</A>, now wants to invest in some croquet lessons.</P>

<P>It wasn't all grass and skirts though. Got a couple of decent nights out in West End with <A HREF="../images/Family/sea-dog.jpg">Brian</A> (it was his birthday!!) and the rest of the bro's and Michael and separately with <A HREF="../images/USA/fitz-fashion.jpg">Fitz</A>.</P>

<P>Steffi sent me a <A HREF="../images/Family/Jamie-6.jpg">great pic of Jamie</A> aged 6 and 3/4!! Quite the little fella.</P>

<P><B>Apr</B></P>

<P>A lot of stuff on the family front with the death of <A HREF="mum.html">our Mum</A>.</P>

<P>Went <A HREF="../skiing/3-valleys-06.html">skiing in Feb</A> with Dom/Shell/Garan/Sara/Stu/Pia and <A HREF="../climbing/northern-corries-feb06.html">climbing</A> with Raph and Ali.</P>

<P>Had loads of med' stuff done in Mar, but managed to clamber back aboard the bike for <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_06.html">the HONC</A> in April.</P>

<P><B>Jan</B></P>

<P>Got in loads of biking. Road biking with Francis, Dave and Jules and MTB with the usual crowd.</P>

<P>Nipped down to London with Ali to spend a weekend with Toby in <A HREF="../images/UK/little-venice.jpg">Little Venice</A>. Wandering round the <A HREF="../images/UK/paddington-basin.jpg">canals</A> and into <A HREF="../images/UK/motos.jpg">the west end</A> was great in the wintry sun. Took in Wildlife Photographer of Year at <A HREF="../images/UK/nat-hist-win05.jpg">Natural History Museum</A>, wandered down Portobello Road market (<A HREF="../images/UK/portobello.jpg">spot the serial killer</A>) and took the boat down to Greeenwich for the market and <A HREF="../images/UK/nat-mari-greenwich05.jpg">museum</A>. As ever, London was great and Toby was his usual chilled host self.</P>

<H2>2005</H2>

<img src="../images/Biking/wheelcraft.jpg" width="469" height="637" border="1" alt="Mum & Dad with big Al at Wheelcraft">

<P><B>Winter</B></P>

<P>Winter's focus has been on <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">Challenger</A> thus far. But the ski/climbing season beckons :o)</P>

<P>Ashliegh found this <A HREF="../images/Family/fred-perry.jpg">cracking pic</A> of Dezmond. Anyone know when it was taken?</P>

<P>Finished off the year up in Glasgow. Had a gorgeous morning up around <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/mugdock-pond.jpg">Mugdock</A> with a <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/mugdock-frost.jpg">thick frost</A> over everything. Spun round the Highlands with Michelle buying a bunch of snow gear and ended up having a few days climbing around <A HREF="../images/Climbing/kingy-05.jpg">Glencoe</A>. Got some nice bits of biking in with <A HREF="../images/Biking/michael-secret-snow-05.jpg">Michael</A> and did some indoor stuff with <A HREF="../images/Climbing/fitz-liam-ratho.jpg">Fitz</A> over at Ratho.</P>

<P><B>Autumn</B></P>
<P>Autumn has started with a <A HREF="../travel/california_2005.html">trip to California</A> with Fitz. All went well and met up with some new folk in San Francisco.</P>


<P><B>Summer</B></P>

<P>Spent a week up in <A HREF="../living_spaces/glasgow.html">Glasgow</A> in August which coincided with Steffi and <A HREF="../images/Family/jamie-trampoline.jpg">Jamie</A> being over. Did the Pedal For Scotlland ride with <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-05.jpg">young Michael </A>and the Leukaemia ride with both Michaels!</P>

<P> After the success of the UK Challenger event, most of the summer's focus was on biking and climbing. There was the regular biking during the week, the big <A HREF="../biking/morzine-05.html">Alps bike trip</A> with Crispin and the big <A HREF="../climbing/arolla-05.html">Alps climbing trip</A> with Leo, Julian and Steve.  There was a week up in <A HREF="../living_spaces/glasgow.html">Glasgow</A> in August where I caught up with Fitz to plan the California trip and obviously a lot of catchup wit the family</P>

<P>All of that didn't leave much time for other folk, but at the start of September, I finally managed to get up to Chesterfield to see Andy and Annie. We met up at <A HREF="../images/UK/chatsworth.jpg">Chatsworth</A> (which was excellent) and then did a bunch of running and walking the next day. Lots of quality pubs with great views, including <A HREF="../images/UK/crispins-boozer.jpg">this one</A>. Check out the name! Never having done much walking in the Peaks, I was well impressed with the place. If you get over there, don't miss <A HREF="../images/UK/uncle-geoffs.jpg">Uncle Geoff's Diner</A> in Over Haddon. He's stone deaf, so you need to write all the orders on notes for him. Definitely the sort of place you'd fit into your evening bike run if you lived in the area. The locals are very friendly and these <A HREF="../images/UK/peak-artists.jpg">wee girls</A> were raising money for Make Poverty History by flogging their artwork.</P>

<P><B>Jun</B></P>
<P> The <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">Challenger</A> stuff went from strength to strength and our close working as a team was the key to the win. We're likely to lose a couple of team members in the months ahead and we'll need to form a strategy for the Worlds in the light of that. </P>

<P>Steve passed another milestone this month and Rose laid on <A HREF="../images/Pals/steves-BBQ-05.jpg">a cracking BBQ</A> in their secret little garden to celebrate. <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/yosemite.jpg"><A HREF="../images/Pals/steves-BBQ-05-2.jpg">Nice chilled evening</A></A>, but a bit of a late start on Monday!</P>


<P><B>Apr - May</B></P>
<P> Met lots of new folk through Challenger. Lots of <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod2.jpg">training</A> and a few great nights out. Most recent was training weekend in Cambrian Mountains in Wales. There's no easy explanation for <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-andys-forked.jpg">some of these pictures</A>, and it's not always clear what <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-scary-garan.jpg">the link</A> to Challenger is, but everyone seemed to be having <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-goes-postal.jpg">a good time</A> :o) And <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-road-trip.jpg">despite appearances</A>, it wasn't taken too seriously. Find out more about it on the <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">new page</A>.</P>

<P>Got up to Glasgow at the end of the month and get a bunch of <A HREF="../images/Biking/onone.jpg">biking</A> and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/ash-pink.jpg">climbing</A> in. Spend a fair bit of time getting wheels sorted for the Pompino out at Wheelcraft. <A HREF="../images/Biking/wheelcraft.jpg">Mum & Dad come out</A>, which is a nice link as Dad used to race singlespeeds in the forties for the Nightingales which is the club that Alistair at Wheelcraft is still a member of. Lots of "Did you know old Charlie ...".</P>


<P><B>Feb</B></P>
<P>Got down to Toby's in Little Venice. Top hospitality and top boozers in Maida Vale, but he's taking these spinning classes <A HREF="../images/Pals/toby-spins.jpg">way too seriously</A>. Met up with <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-tower.jpg">the Fishers</A> on the same trip. Great fun to see them all again and help them get the best out of their short trip to London. It was bloody cold in town, but we got around and checked out <A HREF="../images/Pals/st-pauls.jpg">St.Pauls</A>, <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-beef.jpg">The Tower</A>, <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-globe.jpg">the Globe</A> and <A HREF="../images/Pals/eye-feb-05.jpg">The Eye</A>. In what turned into a busy weekend, it was good to catch up with Lynne from the <A HREF="../travel/morocco_2004.html">Morocco bike trip</A>.</P>

<P>There's now a regular film thing happening. <I>Merchant of Venice</I> is the best of the bunch this month. Gimme a shout if you want details of when & where.</P>

<P>Back up in Glasgow towards end of month and, among other things, ended up spending time with Iain at his 40th (nice pirate look <A HREF="../images/Pals/iains-40.jpg">in the Buff</A>). Good to catch up with Dick Gorman and Fitz as well.</P>


<P><B>Jan</B></P>

<P>Years got off to a good start with plenty of biking, <A HREF="../skiing/aosta.html">skiing</A> and climbing already and it's only Jan!</P>

<P>Andy sorted out tix to go and see <A HREF="../images/Pals/glawster.jpg">Gloucester</A> playing Stade Francais in the last qualifier for the Heineken Cup. Unfortunately the <A HREF="../images/Pals/shedded.jpg">Shed's</A> expectation were not lived up to and the few <A HREF="../images/Pals/line-out.jpg">high points</A> that Gloucester had came to naught. I reckon we should go to the final in Edinburgh anyway :o)</P>

<P>Went for a wander around Ardmore with Brian and found an <A HREF="../images/Family/sea-dog.jpg">odd souvenir</A>. Turns our there's a bizarre link between the tug the life ring came from and a boat yard that Dad worked at - amazing what you find out on the web.</P>

<P>Hannah Spence passed away in early Jan 05 and the whole family got together to celebrate her life.</P> 


<P><B>New Year</B></P>
<P>A new year and life goes on. It seems to me that we're <A HREF="../images/Family/bros-and-sis.jpg">closer than ever</A>. Need to do something about some of the hat selections though.</P>


<H2>2004</H2>

<img src="../images/Family/nephews-and-nieces.jpg" width="640" height="480" border="1" alt="At Crawford Road">


<P>Bit of a difficult year for all of us, but as ever, looking forward to a better year in 05.</P>

<P><B>Dec</B></P>

<P>As 04 came to an end, <A HREF="../images/Pals/mike-oli.jpg">a few folk</A> came round for <A HREF="../images/Pals/beer.jpg">beers</A> to welcome Ian back to the UK.</P>


<P>There was a bikey theme to the weekend, but <A HREF="../images/Pals/bob.jpg">not everyone</A> felt up for it the next day. It will take a bit of effort, but we'll hopefully work the bike group back up to the <A HREF="../images/Pals/usa-bikers.jpg">numbers</A> in the US.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Pals/ian-pheng.jpg">Pheng</A> arrived just before Christmas and joined the rest of HQ in Wetherspoons on the last working Friday.</P>


<P><B>Nov</B></P>

<P>Met <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/team_lunch.jpg">a bunch of new folk</A> on a trip to Morocco. Biking is the common theme, so looking forward to meeting up again in 05.</P>


<P>As time marches on, the <A HREF="../images/Family/nephews-and-nieces.jpg">nieces and nephews</A> are branching out into their own lives. Hopefully at least <A HREF="../images/Family/michael_paul_frank.jpg">one of them</A> will land a job in New Zealand so I can come bike/climb/ski and most importantly - visit :o)</P>

<P>Staying in touch with <A HREF="../images/Family/steff-jamie.jpg">Steffi and Jamie</A> will be important this year.</P>

<P><B>Jul</B></P>

<P>Did some biking with some <A HREF="../images/Pals/nev-boys.jpg">old friends</A> as well. Look forward to more in 05.</P>


<P>Caroline and John moved out of Crawford Road and into Clober Road. <A HREF="../images/Family/martins.jpg">Laughs all round </A>as Ashleigh suggests Caroline gives her the keys for the Boxster. Meanwhile, <A HREF="../images/Family/the-dogs.jpg">the pooches</A> are preserving their dignity and energy by soaking up some rays.</P>

<P>Over all the mayhem, <A HREF="../images/Family/mum-and-dad.jpg">Mum & Dad</A> just keep doing their thing.</P>

<P>All the while, <A HREF="dezmond.html">Dezmond</A> is in our hearts and minds. As close to us now as he ever was.</P>





<P>I'm looking forward to meeting up with <A HREF="../images/Pals/thomas-und-carmen.jpg">Thomas and Carmen</A> in their new place in Winterthur.</P>
