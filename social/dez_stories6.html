<P>From an early age it was clear Dezmond was a natural comedian.He would use these talents to shock,entertain and educate his grateful companions. My  earliest recollection of the blonde bombshell at work was when the family lived inWesterton,Dezmond was three or four. Everyone was in bed about to drift off to sleep and the house was calm, when Dezmond decided to tell a joke. It was a very silly childish joke which created great mirth and uproar among his siblings and deep embarrassment to his parents. I won't tell you the joke as you've probably heard it. Suffice to say it involved an aircraft, a mummy, a daddy,a baby,two parachutes and a certain appendage.</P>

<P>Over the years the family spent many summer holidays by the sea,one of our favourite destinations was Newquay. We visited Newquay a number of times, each time was memorable. On this occasion I was about fifteen and Dezmond was ten. I was a typical adolescent, raging hormones with low i.q. I discussed the boy/girl situation with Dezmond and we decided what was requred was a L.A.with a suitable candidate. The plan we came up with to achieve this goal was to approach complete strangers in the street and chat them up. Our score at the end of the day was L.A's nil,laughs a million-with Dezmond.</P>
