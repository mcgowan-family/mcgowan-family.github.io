<P>The 22 of August was already famous, as the day that Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth, thereby ending the War of the Roses. On the very same day, almost 300 years later,  George III declared the American Colonies to be in a state of open rebellion; a condition from which they have never properly recovered. Almost 250 years were to pass before this day gained its next auspicious landmark, when Paul and Sarah became <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding5.jpg">Mr & Mrs McGowan</A>.</P>

<P>The day had started with me at Steve and Jas's <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding1.jpg">getting my act together</A>. I'm sure it was like this for George III as well. Some <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding2.jpg">minor tweaks</A> to the outfit, <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding3.jpg">a finishing touch</A> from Jas and we were ready to go.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding4.jpg">Sarah</A> had set off from Clare Mews in her gorgeous dress and met up with some <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding6.jpg">unexpected guests</A> in Cirencester.</P>

<P>The registry office in Cirencester seemed a good place to <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding8.jpg">make our entrance</A>. As we <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding9.jpg">made our vows</A>, and <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding10.jpg">exchanged rings</A>, it all got <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding11.jpg">nicely emotional</A>, but we made it through to <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding12.jpg">kissing the bride</A>. Apparently I didn't lean forwards enough!</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding13.jpg">Peter and Pat</A> looked on as we <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding14.jpg">signed the register</A>. Then we grabbed some quick pic's:</P>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding15.jpg">Peter & Pat and Caroline & John</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding17.jpg">Rob, Jackie and Pat</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding18.jpg">It's legal!</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding19.jpg">Steve & Jas</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/wedding21.jpg">Paul & Sar</A></LI>


<P>Outside again. Looks like <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding22.jpg">Number 10</A>! Well I thought this was a <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding20.jpg">nice picture of Caroline</A>. And we both thought <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding23.jpg">the bouquet </A>was lovely ;o) When we <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding25.jpg">told Patrick</A> he was very excited and wanted to make sure we knew <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding24.jpg">he approved</A>.</P>

<P>We were both <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding26.jpg">feeling pretty good</A> about it all, and that's before we added any champagne. So we all headed off to <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding27.jpg">The Fleece</A> in Cirencester. Add your own comment to <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding28.jpg">this one</A>. <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding29.jpg">Muncher</A> wasn't that impressed. If Steve ever gives up medicine, <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding30.jpg">wedding photography</A> beckons. </P>

<P>When it was time to go, we said <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding34.jpg">goodbye to Patrick</A> and he was handed over to <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding32.jpg">Grandma and Grandad</A>. We said cheerio to <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding31.jpg">family and friends</A> and <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding35.jpg">headed off</A> to the station. By the time we got on Eurostar, it was <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding36.jpg">all sinking in</A>.</P>
