<P>We had always planned to have a nice wee party to mark getting married and Sarah decided on a ceilidh. We checked out venues and settled on Cranham Village Hall and we were really fortunate to be able to book Mark Evans band, <A HREF="http://www.diskan.co.uk/">Diskan</A>. When the 26th September came around, all that was left was to get <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh3.jpg">everyone on the bus</A>, <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh1.jpg">fire up the band</A>, figure out <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh2.jpg">where Brian was</A> and set off.</P>

<P>As soon as the beer and square slice came out, <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh4.jpg">everyone cheered up</A> enormously. And while some tried <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh5.jpg">hiding outside</A>, <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh6.jpg">Fletch asked Ash</A> if his dance lessons had paid off. A ceilidh can be a cross between country dancing and <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh7.jpg">full contact Twister</A>.</P>

<P>The man from Uley Brewing had said that <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh8.jpg">one polybin would be enough!</A> Fortunately we hadn't had too much before <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh9.jpg">trying this</A>. You can't escape all <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh10.jpg">the tradition</A>. It was <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh11.jpg">a great night</A>. Meanwhile, <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh12.jpg">back at the polybin</A> .......</P>

<P>While <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh13.jpg">the two Gerry's</A> find something to laugh about, a media first happens at the other end of the hall, when <A HREF="../images/Family/ceilidh14.jpg">Maureen poses </A>for a picture!!!</P>

<P>Strip the Willow is always a classic:</P>
