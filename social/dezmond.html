<P>Desmond died suddenly in the late afternoon of 10 May, 2004. He was 45. Husband of Steffi, father of Jamie, son of Pat and Pearl and brother/uncle/friend to the rest of us.</P>

<P>It's natural to be sad, angry, dazed and look for reasons as to how this could have happened. As time goes by, the feelings of grief will diminish and it's the good stuff we'll remember. Some of the good stuff appears below.</P>
