<P>My earliest memories of Dezmond were all about sharing the back room at 9 Clochbar. On Saturday morning's we'd peel back the bedcovers and use the mattress as the scene for early morning wrestling bouts. At that time, Dezmond had yet to develop the greatness of spirit that would allow the smaller child, me, to win. So I generally ended up flying across the room and watching Mick McManus later in the day to figure out where I'd gone wrong.</P>

<P>The first music I remember from him was Rod Stewart and Maggie May. Fortunately, he was later to outgrow this or I may not have turned into the rounded individual you see today. He picked up music from his big brothers and I picked up music from him. There's a selection of <A HREF="dez_music.html">some favourite stuff </A>elsewhere on the site.</P>

<P>Another early memory, is of him challenging his uncles to swimming contests on the beach at Girvan. He was determined to show that he could swim all the way out Paddy's Milestone and back and got really mad when there was a bit of light-hearted teasing that he'd never make it. I don't think he ever tried, but kicking against the system became a bit of a theme.</P>

<P>He was without doubt at the rock and roll end of the family and the rest of us were enrichened, in a variety of ways, by that. I remember getting stopped one night by the police in Craigton Rd. After checking us all with the torch, they asked "You're Dezmond McGowan's brother aren't you". How cool was this, he's a villain, it was like having Steve McQueen or Butch Cassidy in your family, and I got to be cool just by association.</P>

<P>Dezmond got into the eastern influences early in life. For some reason, he ended up cooking me Vesta meals as a regular Friday night  treat in what I guess was the early seventies. Vesta meals don't sound very exotic, but it seemed pretty on the edge at the time to me and the fact that he was cooking it for me made it all the better. This was the first time I'd seen anyone other than my Mother cook and it was the start of a <A HREF="dez_grub.html">lifelong connection with cooking</A> and developing a caring side to his character.</P>

<P>Later when I was at Uni in Glasgow, Dezmond ended up living in the TM centre in Clouston Drive. For me, this was my time to get close to him and share things. I'd spend many evening's round there after class and there would always be music on. He'd make tea, from a wide selection, and take care with everything. He'd make me dinner, strictly macrobiotic, and we'd talk about music, films, travel, clothes, what he was doing in the TM and just stuff. As Michael reminded me, it was at this point that he mastered 'the perfect pot of rice', brown of course. </P>

<P>I guess it was because he hadn't got married, that I'd caught up a bit in age, so we had more in common. We'd hitch hike around the place, and I can remember on a trip up to LochEarnHead a woman asking if we were twins. I have to say, Dezmond found this funnier than I did.</P>

<P>Now we were more talking as brothers and friends and my life was enriched in quite a different way. I still got to feel cool about having the only big brother in class that could actually levitate, but he had now matured into a very clear and singular life. Disconnected from the material mainstream, and high in quality.</P>

<P>Whenever he did buy stuff, it was on those things that interested him most: a high end Walkman, a gorgeous hat, a box of Duma, herbs & spices, a pearl handled pen-knife.</P>

<P>Dezmond was a natural fit for the West End. Hip and liberal, into eastern philosophy, style guru from Oxfam, and regular bar fly at the Ubiquitous Chip.</P>

<P>He had a long association with the TM movement that lasted 20 years or more. He worked and stayed in places around England: Dovedale in the Peaks, Skelmersdale and Baddingham in Suffolk. By this time I was living in England, so I'd hitch to wherever he was and spend weekends. He'd cook, we'd go for walks, play the guitar and do some birdwatching. I even got tips on hitching; in case you're interested, you hang around the petrol stations and ask politely where folk are going, the Milngavie accent works a treat.</P>

<P>So I finally got into playing the guitar as well. Dezmond taught me a tune I could play up and down the fret board and I just played that all the time. After a couple of years I thought I better try something else and Dezmond introduced me to Tommy Orr.</P>

<P>After the West End, Dezmond moved to Germany. Many of us were lucky enough to go over and spend time with him there. I visited him in Sasbachwalden, Nahe and a number of times in Traben.</P>

<P>Many great memories from these trips. Near Sasbach, is the spa town of Baden-Baden and the Karacala spa. All brushed aluminium, plunge pools and serious looking pool-guards. We were going for saunas and then jumping in the pools, there were cold hoses and big douche buckets. One thing led to another and we ended up having a hose fight. Needless to say this didn't go down well with the attendants and we got thrown out.</P>

<P>He had a great big Dryz-a-Bone overcoat, and one night was spent lying in a grassy field at Nahe with heavy spring rain falling down on him. Just lying there, loving life.</P>

<P>When he lived on Wildstrasse in Traben, the swimming pool was just up the road, so we went up there on the summer afternoons when I was there. Chips with sauce, swimming in the pool and lying in the sun.</P>

<P>Thinking about it, he really loved swimming, especially in cool, fresh water. Most of you will know the Abey Loch up above Mugdock and that was always a regular spot for him in the summers.</P>

<P>As part of doing TM, Dezmond had trained as a massage technician, lots of eastern health treatments. He ended up on telly doing this on breakfast TV and I remember him trying to stop himself laughing as he was working away in the background. On one trip to Traben, him and John were kind enough to give me a massage and it was incredible. I left the clinic as if I was floating on air. A  special gift from a  special big brother.</P>

<P>His life seemed very happy and content then. He was particular about all the little things that brought happiness to him and others. Lovely white linen sheets, flowers and a chocolate on your pillow when you arrived to stay. He was happy to just sit in the kitchen, having a smoke, chatting listening to music, getting up late, having beers in the cafes in town.</P>

<P>Likemany of us, he had a delight in collecting things that just appealed to him. He had the harmonicas, the tea, the lighters, the pen knifes, the music, the mountain bike and at some point he picked up the black and silver Triumph Thunderbird. More Steve McQueen there. I'll always remember ripping along the highway from Bernkastel to Traben on the back of that bike. Wind in our face and just laughing.</P>

<P>In Traben, Dezmond met and married Steffi and Jamie was born. We are delighted to have Steffi as part of our family and hopefully over the years ahead, we can provide support to her and Jamie in whatever ways we can. And in them, there will always be a part of Dezmond with all of us.</P>

<P>So those were some memories from me.  But there are lots of gaps, I've not much idea what he got up to in Shetland or on the rigs. I keep remembering new stuff all the time. So all of us will have many memories that fill in the gaps and make the whole. So if you think that you've something you'd like to add to that; a story, a picture, a favourite tape he once lent you, then let me know and I'll add it to this collection. </P>

<P>Whatever your beliefs are, there is no doubt that through these memories Dezmond does live on after death in all of us.</P>
