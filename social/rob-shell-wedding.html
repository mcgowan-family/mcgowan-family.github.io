<h1>Rob and Shell's Wedding, 30th July, Duntreath</h1>

<p>This was to be the second great wedding of the year. This time, we ewre all going up - and <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-1.jpg">Patrick was getting a kilt!</a>!! As you can tell, he's <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-2.jpg">very excited</a>. Bryher was going to be a bridesmaid, so all in all, <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-3.jpg">everyone was looking pretty good</a>.</p>


<p>Our plans took a knock on the way up when we had a complete power failure on the Volvo just as we passed through the Lakes. Four hours on the side of the M6. Fortunately the weather was good and <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-4.jpg">everyone kept their sense of humour</a>.</p>

<p>We had rented <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-6.jpg">a lovely wee bothy</a> up by Gartmore, which was quite close to teh wedding venue at Duntreath by Blanefield. Patrick and Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-5.jpg">the nicest wee loft room</a>.</p>

<p>It was the day of the wedding and, in a fitting way, <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-7.jpg">the Gale</a> were out in force.</p>

<p>We had dropped Bryher off with the rest of the girls earlier in the morning to get ready. She had had a whale of a time and kept everyone amused. With great composure, <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-8.jpg">she led the bride</a> and the other maids down towards <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-9.jpg">the site of the ceremony</a> and then <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-10.jpg">the main character</a> of the day arrived!</p>

<p>It was the loveliest ceremony, held in an old folly in the garden of <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-12.jpg">Duntreath Castle</a>. The weather was very kind and the sun shone on Rob & Shell. They had set up <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-11.jpg">a marquee in the grounds</a> which looked lovely.</p>

<p>Then there were all the photos, and of course <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-13.jpg">Bryher had to get in them</a>. We wandered off round the grounds, <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-14.jpg">round the pond</a> and found the Blane roaring along behind the boundary fence. there was plenty to explore and <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-16.jpg">John and Hugo</a> went off for a wander as well.</p>

<p> Rob and Shell came back for <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-15.jpg">a great reception</a> from the crowd. It was time to get the party started, and <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-17.jpg">Ash sang a lovely lament</a>. <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-19.jpg">The dancing kicked off</a>. Not a great draw for wee boys, so <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-18.jpg">Patrick went and found a wall</a> to climb on. But he did seem to make <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-23.jpg">a special friend</a>!</p>

<p>As the evening wore on, the dancing got wilder, but for those <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-20.jpg">getting long in the tooth</a>, it was time for bed.</p>


<p>We had a lovely next day, <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-21.jpg">exploring around Gartmore </a>and <a href="../images/Family/wedding2-0716-22.jpg">catching up with cousins</a>. then it was back down the road to Cheltenham. A lovely wedding and a lovely weekend, that none of us will forget.</p>
