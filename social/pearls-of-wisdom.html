<H1>Pearls of Wisdom</H1>

<H3>1979
Get Better Organised</H3>



<LI>1. Fill more into your life.</LI>
<LI>2. Get up one hour earlier, or go one hour later.</LI>
<LI>3. Clear out cupboards, keeping essentials.</LI>
<LI>4. Set up a home "office" box, drawer or bag.</LI>
<LI>5. Cheat at housework. A few fresh flowers, plumped up cushions, folded newspapers etc.</LI>
<LI>6. Buy a pin-board; stick up invitations, bills, lists, reminders, keys, scissors etc.</LI>
<LI>7. Have a diary and write down everything you need to do NOW, Why wear your brain out?</LI>
<LI>8. STOP! Gambling and raise hell instead. Take action!</LI>
<LI>9. Become a kidney donor and keep your card in your diary or wallet.</LI>
<LI>10. Put yourself out for a friend instead of saying quietly, oh, I meant to write or drop in - actually do it. Phone.</LI>


<LI>Change your style - 
Bright is might. Orange - turquoise ­ yellow. Altogether.
Bright shoes, gloves, if you like - Liz Taylor sized gems.</LI>


<LI>11. Take a ruthless look at your wardrobe. Give away everything you don't love. Dress up to go to work. Wear your favourite clothes until they drop.</LI>
<LI>12. Buy yourself a small handbag.</LI>
<LI>13. Start saving for your holiday at once. Thomas Cook operates a Budget Travel scheme, which pays interest on the monthly sum.</LI>
<LI>14. Put money in a Building Society.</LI>
<LI>15. Take a gamble. To hell with playing safe. Go to an auction.</LI>
<LI>16. Take a break ­ alone.</LI>
<LI>17. Blow a months salary on a new look.</LI>
<LI>18. Change your routine. Do you always travel to work the same way, drink the same drink, wear the same colour. Monitor your habits and alter them. Make love in the afternoon, cut off your hair, drink exotic cocktails.</LI>

<P>Even the smallest changes can be hugely stimulating and lead to greater ones.
