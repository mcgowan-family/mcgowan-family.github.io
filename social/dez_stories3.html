<P>Dez walks into the room, sticks his driving license on the table and says, "Check this out". He'd gone and registered himself on his license as Major Desmond McGowan. They'd printed it up just like he'd put it down.</P>

<P>Not to be outdown, I went in and registered myself as a Flight-Lieutenant!</P>

<P>One night we were going into a party at some girl's house in Bearsden. We were just about to go through the door when Dez grabbed me and said, "We need a flower." So he grabs a couple out of her garden and sticks them in our lapels ... sorted.</P>

<P>Another time I met Dez for a coffee in the West End. I was feeling kind of nervous as I had an appointment at the clinic. Dez said he'd come along with me for moral support. All the way there, he was giving me this lecture on sexual promiscuity. At the door, he said, "OK, d'you want to hold hands?". Whatever, I thought; so we walks in hand in hand. I walked up to the desk, but before I could do anything, Dez slaps an appointment card on the table. One minute I'm trying to figure out how he nicked my card, then I realised that he had his own appointment all the time - typical.</P>
