<P>Patrick was christened at <A HREF="../images/Family/st-marys.jpg">St.Mary's,</A> Charlton Kings on Sunday 24th May 2009. It was a stunning day, with gorgeous blue skies. Sarah had made <A HREF="../images/Family/the-spread.jpg">an amazing spread</A> of food and we set out the garden at Cirencester Road for <A HREF="../images/Family/garden-party1.jpg">a garden party</A>. Gaynor made <A HREF="../images/Family/christening-cake.jpg">a lovely cake</A>.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Pals/ball-pool.jpg">All his little mates</A> were there, along with<A HREF="../images/Family/garden-party2.jpg"> family and friends</A>. And <A HREF="../images/Pals/piccolo.jpg">little Piccolo</A> was looking smarter then ever.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Family/shell-patrick.jpg">Shell</A> was over from Canada, with <A HREF="../images/Family/shell-helene.jpg">her friend Helene</A> (who took quite a few of the pic's). <A HREF="../images/Pals/steve-jas-ash.jpg">Steve and Jas</A> went to the wrong christening - very funny :o) And <A HREF="../images/Pals/gals.jpg">Vic and Sue</A> added the glamour ;o)</P>
