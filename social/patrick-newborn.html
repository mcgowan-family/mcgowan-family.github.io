<P><A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-day-before.jpg">Before he arrived</A>, there was just enough time to make sure that everything was ready.</P>

<P>11th December was the big day. He arrived by caesarean section at 0947 and weighed in at 8 pounds 1.5 ounces. <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-sarah.jpg">Mum and baby</A> were doing well straight away. And although this looks like <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-paul.jpg">a bunch of towels</A>, there really is a little boy in there.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-proud-grands.jpg">proud grandparents</A> arrived to see him straight away. And while I was getting quite used to <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-paul2.jpg">kipping in the hospital chair</A>, we decided to <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-home.jpg">take the wee fella home</A>.</P>

<P>Of course everyone wanted to meet the new arrival. <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-caroline.jpg">Caroline</A> came down to say hello. <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-rob.jpg">Uncle Rob</A> popped round. It was <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-thoughtful.jpg">all a bit much</A> for a little man to take. <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-ash.jpg">Ashleigh</A> dropped down with Chris. And then it was time for ....</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-christmas1.jpg">Christmas</A> will never be the same again. <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-christmas2.jpg">Everyone got dressed up</A> in their best togs. We popped round to see his Great great <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-enid.jpg">Aunt Enid</A>. Looking pretty amazing at 96. And all the rest of <A HREF="../images/Family/fletcher-family.jpg">the Fletchers</A> were there too.</P>

<P>The New Year, brought some <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-teddy.jpg">new friends</A>. We had everyone round for<A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-burns.jpg"> Burn's Night</A> and Patrick got all dressed up again. </P>

<P>And at the end of January, we took Patrick up to Glasgow to meet the rest of the clan. He was <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-tintin.jpg">pretty excited</A>. He met all his big cousins and aunts and uncles and even a great aunt or two. It was hard to get him away from <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-gerry.jpg">Gerry</A>, but we managed to drop in on Nan on the way back down. We didn't see everyone, but we did pertty well. Guess we'll just have to go back up again soon :o)</P>
