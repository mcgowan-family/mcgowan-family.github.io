<P>On the evening of 20th December 2014, I was out in the garage breaking up firewood for kindling. Work and school had broken up the day before and teh day before that, the Cordingly family had been to visit in what was feeling like a great end to the year. We had lived at the Rectory for a year and a half and life was settling in to a pattern: family breakfasts, work and school, lots of work on the Rectory to bring it back from the state it had been in. Lots of little holidays and camping in te summer; hunkered down in the wonter. We were definitley getting over the hump of some hard years work and hopefully next year would continue the trend. Then on the night of the 20th, the longest night, Sarah came out and told me that she was pregnant.</P>


<p>We are both really happy about this. We hadn't been looking for it, but we do both love the family life, so more family life feels like a very natural and positive thing. That said, it has been a hard couple of years and there's no doubt that a pregnancy and a baby is going to put us  back in a hard place for a while with two young kids already on the go. But what are you going to do :)</p>


<p>The first thing we both realised as well, is that a pregnancy this late for Sarah, comes with a whole load of potential complications, so in all of this, there is a very real chance (maybe a 1 in 2 chance) that the pregnancy will miscarry. This happened once before. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>23 Dec. Sarah's hormone levels are really high. Lots of different foods making her feel unwell - smel of coffee, oranges. She likes avocadoes all of a sudden.</p>

<p>Two weeks on, 4 Jan, and Sarah is still pregnant. That may seem an odd thing to say, but after the last time, and two years on, we're both all too aware that there is every chance that we won't go full term. Despite every intention to keep it to ourselvesfor the first twelve weeks, Sarah caved and told Lisa today :) The news was greeted with squeaks of delight. Ironically this came at the end of Oatrick's first proper sleep over with James. We had both had a gorgeous night of peace and tranquility where we realised just how easy one child is. The obviousl corollary is just how crazy 3 kids will be!</p>

<p>It's now week 9, end of Jan. Still pregnant. The baby will have ears, closed eyes and a heart beat. We had the first visit from the mid-wife this week. Her name's Becky. Sarah bought a heart rate monitor but  can't hear the heart yet. Bit early :) First scan is booked in for 23 Feb.</p>


<p>1 Feb 2015. Week 10. Candlemas. Sarah bought a dopler heart monitor and we used it successfully  tonight to fond the baby's heart beat. So at week 10, the unknown child has moved from an idea to a physical reality. So this is the first note from Mum & Dad to the unknown child. Today I fixed the Triumph bike, it's running again, Patrick bought his first rugby boots, we took Bryher for a walk over the fields by the church. I painted the Walnut bedroom window off a scaffold, your Mum made a cake with Bryher, I sawed up some logs for the fire, we tried to calm the Rayburn down - it was running at 400 degrees. We booked a week in Chamonix to take Patrick and Bryher on their first ski trip. We lit the fire, Patrick and Bryher settled down to bed, then we set about finding you. Pretty pleased to locate you at only 10 weeks, a strong heart, 170 beats a minute. Welcome to the world, welcome to our family.</p>

<p>Now 1 April and all still well. We had the first scan a month back and it's definitely one baby and not twins. Next scan is next week and Sarah is keen to find out if we have another boy or a girl. She' spretty sure it's a girl.  Patrick and Bryher have gotten used to the idea and everyone else now knows that we're pregnant again. Lots of happy families and friends. Lovely to hear how pleased everyone is for us.</p>

<p>Well, it turns out it's a boy. And that was quite the surprise for Sarah! Just as well she found out now as the expectation tat it was a girl,  and the subsequent surprise that it wasn't, was more than I was expecting. So all the little girl clothes that we've been keeping for Bonny are now heading to Emily. The name Joseph has stuck so far, but early days yet.</p>
