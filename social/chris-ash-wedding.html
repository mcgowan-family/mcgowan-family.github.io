<h1>Chris and Ashliegh's Wedding, 23rd February, Fortingall</h1>

<p>In mid Feb 2016, I drove up to Scotland, picked up my brother Brian and headed into <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-1-feb-16.jpg">
</a>. The date for Ashliegh and Chris's wedding had been set many years before, the venue at Fortingall at the mouth of Glen Lyon was a more recent addition - but <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-2-feb-16.jpg">what a great venue</a>!</p>

<P>Me and Brian had headed up to the day before to the high pass at the head of the glen to mess around in the snow - <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-3-feb-16.jpg">there is a road under this</a>. But the next day, it was time to <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-4-feb-16.jpg">get into your highland gear</a> and <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-5-feb-16.jpg">wait for the bride to arrive</a>.</P>

<P>Fortingall Vilage Hall was an inspired location and was the perfect backdrop to <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-6-feb-16.jpg">the main event</a>.</P>

<P><a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-7-feb-16.jpg">Maureen seldom looked better</a>. Not sure if it's Gerry's best shot, but pretty funny. <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-8-feb-16.jpg">Caroline and John</a> looking well. They'll <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-9-feb-16.jpg">always have each other</a> :)</P>


<p>It really was one of <a href="../images/Family/ash-wedding-10-feb-16.jpg">the loveliest weddings ever</a>. </p>
