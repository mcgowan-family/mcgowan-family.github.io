<P>We were all staying away at someones house and it had been a long night. I woke up before it was properly light and could hear this really weird scratching noise. Every few minutes there was this horrible scraping noise coming from somewhere just outside the window. Pretty scary.</P>

<P>Eventually we checked outside to see what was happening. Dez had found a skateboard and was running it down this slope in front of the house in the middle of the night. "Check it out", he said, "This slopes got the perfect angle!".</P>

<P>Another time, I hadn't seen Dez for quite a while. I'd just moved into my new house and he was living in town. I woke up in the middle of the night. Someone was throwing stones at the window. It was about 4 in the morning and near mid-summer, so it was already light.</P>

<P>When I looked out the window, Dez was standing in the garden. "D'you fancy going for a coffee?". Like I said, it was 4 in the morning :o)</P>

<P>We were up at the Abey one day, like you were saying in the service. Everyone was in the usual spot on the rocks. After a while, Dez arrived and hiked his way down the other side of the loch. Typical that he couldn't just go with the flow.</P>

<P>He started getting his gear off and before I knew it, he had stripped right off, but he was a long way across the other side of the loch. Anyway, he jumps in and starts swimming over towards us. I'm getting this bad feeling and sure enough, he swims right over and starts getting out of the water. It was a mixed crowd and I'm thinking "No way man!". Of course he goes the whole hog and just walks casually up and stands chatting away, stark bollock naked, commenting on how nice the water is. Just the way he was.</P>
