<P>Dezmond stayed with me in London a few times. On one visit, we were out on the town and came across a publicity stunt for the latest Sylvester Stallone movie. There was a motorbike that featured as a central prop in the film - all chrome and over the top gadgets. This bike was being displayed in a shop window and there was a big crowd standing round the window checking it out.</P>

<P>The area was roped off to stop the crowd getting too close. Me and Dez were standing watching all this going on. One minute, I was standing next to Dez looking at the bike, and the next minute I was standing watching Dez sitting on the bike, in the shop window, with this huge grin on his face.</P>

<P>Security guards appeared from all over and started dragging Dez off the bike and he just hung on, grinning. That's what he was like.</P>
