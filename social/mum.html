<P>Our Mum died suddenly during the morning of 28 February, 2006. She was 84.</P>

<P>It happened out of the blue, but maybe that was for the best. She always was spontaneous. Once again, I'm struck by the sense that physical loss, brings no loss of real presence. Hannah described her as a right little battler; I think she'd have liked that.</P>

<P>We had <A HREF="mums-eulogy.html">some words</A> to say on the day.</P>

<P><A HREF="mum_pics.html">Some wonderful pictures</A>.</P>
