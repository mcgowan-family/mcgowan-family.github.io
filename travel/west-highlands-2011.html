</DIV>

<P>Memories of our trip to Normandy and Brittany had faded sufficiently to allow us to think that going away in the van for a couple of weeks would be good fun.</P>

<p>We stopped off with Dave & Jules in Wetherby, then headed for Glasgow. A hectic couple of days followed where we caught up with everyone, then it was back into the van and off to the Western Highlands.</p>

<p>Our first stop was on the shore of Loch Linnhe, just North of the Connel Bridge at North Ledaig. It was <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-01.jpg">a beautiful first pitch</a> and what a treat to be able ot roll out of the van onto the beach. Dinner was fish & chips that night, and everything seemed to rhyme with our own childhood days as <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-02.jpg">Sarah and Patrick headed off to get the fish suppers</a>.</p>

<p>From Oban, we caught the CalMac to Mull. We hadn't realised how busy it would be and only just managed <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-03.jpg">to squeeze the van on</a>! We were now on holiday proper and <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-04.jpg">the atmosphere was expectant </a>on board. Mull looked great from the boat, with <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-05.jpg">Castle Dornie</a> the first thing you see.</p>

<p>I had Calgary Bay in mind as somewhere we might head to. But the road there, was a delight in itself. This is looking over the edge of <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-06.jpg">the Eas For</a>, where <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-07.jpg">Patrick practiced his fishing</a> just upstream of the falls.</p>

<p>When we finally made it to Calgary Bay, we found that the formal site was more of an encampment, that took the edge of what was a truly remarkable landscape. But we opted to stay just off the beach and try our first bit of wild camping. Sarah wasn't too sure, but <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-08.jpg">the views overcame her caution</a> :)</p>

<p>There's no such thing as the wrong weather, just the wrong clothing. Fortunately Patrick and Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-09.jpg">the right clothing</a> :) We walked up to the arts centre come cafe and had a lovely lunch. The path back is littered with nice sculptures, some of which double as <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-10.jpg">toddler dens</a>. Bryher was <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-11.jpg">a little wood elf</a> and <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-13.jpg">the setting</a> couldn't have been better.</p>

<p>From Calgary Bay, we headed round to Tobermory. Even <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-14.jpg">a bit of a beach</a>, is still a beach and Patrick and Bryher <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-15.jpg">had great fun</a>.</p>

<p>I decided it was time for a treat, so we got the best room in the best hotel in town - The Western Isles. <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-16.jpg">Bryher was in heaven</a>. Her Mum thought <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-17.jpg">it was pretty good too</a> :)</p>


<p><a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-18.jpg">Tobermory</a> had been kind to us, but it was time to head on. We took the little ferry over to <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-19.jpg">Arnamurchan</a> and from there, headed up through Moidart to Mallaig. The weather turned nasty for a day and we spent the night in a B&B in Mallaig. That's where we met Captain Tommy of the CalMac and he told us about <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-20.jpg">Camusdarach beach</a>.</p>

<p>I had heard of Camusdarach before. It was the beach where Local Hero was filmed, but I'd never been there. <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-21.jpg">What an amazing place.</a> We spent all day there and Patrick and Bryher were <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-22.jpg">in their element</a>.</p>

<p>It was a sad farewell to the Highlands and as we drove past <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-23.jpg">Glen Finnan</a> and stopped off at <a href="../images/Family/west-highlands-0811-24.jpg">the Falls of Falloch</a>, we were sure we'd be back.</p>
