<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Lyme regis, April 2017</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Sarah kindly booked up a little holdiday for all of us down on the SOuth Coast for my birthday. It was in Lyme Regis, somewhere we'd never ben before.</P>

<p>Mossy of course loved the beach and, <a href="../images/Lyme-17/moss-0417.jpg">given how wet he got</a> the first time we went down there, the beach seemed to love him right back . there is a fantastic <a href="http://www.townmill.org.uk">old mill</a> in the town, and you can still <a href="../images/Lyme-17/mill-0417.jpg">grind your own flour</a> there. The falt Sarah had booked  was right across from <a href="../images/Lyme-17/beach-0417.jpg">the town beach</a>. </p>

<p>It was my birthday, so of course, <a href="../images/Lyme-17/cake-0417.jpg">Sarah had made a cake</a>! Just west of Lyme into Devon and the little town of Seaton has <a href="../images/Lyme-17/tram-0417.jpg">its own tram.</a> The famous harbour in Lyme, known as the Cobb, has <a href="../images/Lyme-17/grannys-teeth-0417.jpg">these fantastic steps</a> called the Granny's Teeth. </p>

<p>Most of the time was just <a href="../images/Lyme-17/dad-0417.jpg">hanging about at the beach</a>, which everyone loved. It was Lyme, so Sarah went of and did some <a href="../images/Lyme-17/fossil-0417.jpg">more serious fossil hunting</a>. <a href="../images/Lyme-17/bike-0417.jpg">This is a toy bike</a> - don't tell him.</p>

<p>There's a lovely park that backs onto the beach, with these <a href="../images/Lyme-17/gaudi-0417.jpg">Gaudi-like benches</a> up near the top.</p>

<p>As usual, we took the crab nets and <a href="../images/Lyme-17/crabbing-0417.jpg">much fun was had </a>catching some whoppers!</p>
