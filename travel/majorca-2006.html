<P>There wasn't much of a plan - which left some worried - but the rough outline was to <A HREF="../images/Sailing/alcudia.jpg">get 7 of us on a boat</A> in Palma and head off into the wide, blue yonder and find some adventure!  <A HREF="../images/Sailing/palma1.jpg">Palma itself</A> was excellent, with <A HREF="../images/Sailing/palma2.jpg">wide avenues</A>, the walled city and some decent nightlife.</P>

<P>It took a while to get everyone rounded up, but  once everyone had switched on their mobiles - ahem!! - we got on the boat and headed off.</P>

<P>It was <A HREF="../images/Sailing/palma3.jpg">a 43 foot Bavaria</A> that Chris had booked. Some of the guys had used the company before, so were pretty comfortable with the layout. There was <A HREF="../images/Sailing/palma3.jpg">Chris and Emma</A>, <A HREF="../images/Sailing/formentor2.jpg">Fitzy, Tom and me</A>, <A HREF="../images/Sailing/ships-cat.jpg">John</A> and  <A HREF="../images/Sailing/cabreras1.jpg">the other Chris</A> :o) It was pretty easy to fit us all in.</P>

<P>First stop out of Palma was <A HREF="../images/Sailing/santelmo1.jpg">Sant Elmo</A>, a great little mooring opposite the striking<A HREF="../images/Sailing/santelmo2.jpg"> Isla Dragonera</A>.</P>

<P>From there, we motored  - not much wind :o( up the North West coast. It was fantastic, with <A HREF="../images/Sailing/foradada1.jpg">isolated little fishing villages</A> and <A HREF="../images/Sailing/foradada2.jpg">dramatic rock scapes</A>. Our original 'plan' had been to moor up somewhere on the west side of the Formentor peninsula, but there was a serious swell coming from the NW, so we kept on round the headland <A HREF="../images/Sailing/northwest1.jpg">as the sun set</A> and just made it into a little mooring as darkness descended.</P>


<P>The next morning, we realised <A HREF="../images/Sailing/formentor2.jpg">what a great spot</A> we'd moored up in, with shoals of fish around the boat and nice little cliffs either side of the bay.Of course, I had to go dive in. Now,<A HREF="../images/Sailing/formentor1.jpg"> it didn't look that high</A> from below - when does it ever. But I finally managed a dive that went pretty well. Buoyed up by success, I went for a second leap of faith. It was less successful. The boom from my poor wee body hitting the water must have been heard in far off Palma. Followed by the collective wince and comments of "Oooh that must've hurt." from the boat.</P>

<P>After dropping John in Alcudia to 'go for a walk', we headed across <A HREF="../images/Sailing/alcudia.jpg">the Bay of Alcudia</A> and on round the coast to Cala Rajada. A great little spot with an excellent barber I can recommend.</P>

<P>By now it looked as if we'd make the circumnavigation in the week. We carried on down the East coast, stoped in at Cala Millor (Fitz went to check out the Caves of Draq) and ended the day at <A HREF="../images/Sailing/porto-colom.jpg">Porto Colom</A>. The east coast was the only place we saw dolphins, but it was great fun watching them surf down the waves next to the boat. Too tricky to get any pictures though. The east coast was also <A HREF="../images/Sailing/IMGP0334.MOV">the greatest test of Chris's breakfast skills</A> - keep your eye on the coffee pot to get a sense of the swell (only download with broadband).</P>

<P>From there, we made our way with <A HREF="../images/Sailing/IMGP0338.MOV">a following wind</A> down to the Islas Cabreras. This is a great spot. A small archipelago, which is now a nature reserve. It gets really busy in summer, with up to 50 boats in the large natural harbour, but we practically had the place to ourselves. We went for a few walks, checked out <A HREF="../images/Sailing/cabreras1.jpg">the Napoleonic castle</A>, had a guided tour from the resident zoologist and generally had a very relaxing time of it. There was the mandatory skinny dipping off the back of the boat - fortunately no pictures. </P>

<P>After a couple of days on the Cabreras, it was time to head back to Palma. The last crossing was fantastic, with <A HREF="../images/Sailing/chris-crossing.jpg">force 6 winds</A> and lots of surfing down waves. Great fun.</P>

<P>Once back in Palma, we hooked up with John, had a great last night on the town and headed off the next day. I've never packed so quickly or with such a hangover as the next morning. Hate to think what we left on that boat. Great trip and look forward to doing it again some time :o)</P>
