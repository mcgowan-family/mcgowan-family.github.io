</DIV>

<P>We had been looking forward to Steve and Bethan's wedding in Newport in Pembrokeshire for quite a while. The earlier <a href="stdavids-jun-2012.html">trip to St.Davids</a> had been a nice taster, and we decided to go camp for a week and then finish off with a flourish at the main event.</P>

<p>We found what turned out to be another great campsite, this time on Dinas Head, which lies equidistant between Fishguard and Newport. </p>

<p>The campsite was on a working farm and, if you know Patrick, you can <a href="../images/Family/patrick-dinas-0712.jpg">imagine the magic</a>. Every day was filled with the drama of hay cutting, hay turning and sheep antics.</p>

<p>And when we weren't watching tractors ..... the campsite was a short walk to a couple of great beaches and for Bryher, <a href="../images/Family/bryher-dinas-0712.jpg">it just doesn't get any better than this :)</a></p>

<p>As ever the kids made some great friends and some were particulalrly lovely. <a href="../images/Family/kids-dinas-0712.jpg">Frank and Lucy</a> were just great and spent a lot of time playing with Patrick & Bryher. Good examples to look up to.</p>


<p>Lucy even got to take <a href="../images/Family/dinas-kayak-1-0712.jpg">Patrick</a> and then <a href="../images/Family/dinas-kayak-2-0712.jpg">Bryher</a> out in her kayak! I can see boats in our future.</p>

<p>And after all that lovely camping, we had one last walk around the headland with our new friends, jumped into our posh frocks and headed off in the van to the wedding. Bit surreal. </p>

<p>At the wedding, everyone looked very smart; <a href="../images/Pals/cartwight-wedding-1-0812.jpg">Steve</a> particularly so, but even <a href="../images/Pals/cartwight-wedding-2-0812.jpg">the Sharpes</a> had brushed up well. It was all a bit much for <a href="../images/Pals/cartwight-wedding-3-0812.jpg">one little girl</a>, who missed <a href="../images/Pals/cartwight-wedding-4-0812.jpg">the big send off</a>.</p>

<p>Andf after all that excitement, there was just <a href="../images/Pals/cartwight-wedding-5-0812.jpg">one thing left to do</a>.</p>
