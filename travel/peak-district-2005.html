</DIV>

<P>It was just a weekend, but during September, I finally got up to Andy and Annie's place in Chesterfield.</P>


<P>We met up at <A HREF="../images/UK/chatsworth.jpg">Chatsworth</A> (which was excellent) and then did a bunch of running and walking the next day. Lots of quality pubs with great views, including <A HREF="../images/UK/crispins-boozer.jpg">this one</A>. Check out the name! </P>

<P>Never having done much walking in <A HREF="../images/UK/peak-views.jpg">the Peaks</A>, I was well impressed with the place. If you get over there, don't miss <A HREF="../images/UK/uncle-geoffs.jpg">Uncle Geoff's Diner</A> in Over Haddon. He's stone deaf, so you need to write all the orders on notes for him. Definitely the sort of place you'd fit into your evening bike run if you lived in the area. The locals are very friendly and these <A HREF="../images/UK/peak-artists.jpg">wee girls</A> were raising money for Make Poverty History by flogging their artwork.</P>

<P>We did a walk from Uncle Geoff's down into Lathkill Dale, then over the peaks and down into Bradford Dale and finally back up the <A HREF="../images/UK/dale-views.jpg">River Lathkill</A> to Over Haddon and our start point. Next time, I'll maybe try it from <A HREF="../images/UK/peak-balloons.jpg">the air</A>.</P>
