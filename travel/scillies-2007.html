<P>Towards the end of May 2007, me and Sarah travelled to the Isles of Scilly. We had quite an adventure getting there. The flight from Bristol was cancelled due to bad weather, so we raced down to Penzance and just made the last helicopter flight over to the islands. When we arrived in Hugh Town, we walked into our accommodation to find another family already there!! Somehow, I knew it would be OK in the Scillies and, sure enough, in a couple of hours, they'd fixed us up with a bigger place up in Sally Port with <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/hugh-town.jpg">nice views over Hugh Town</A>.</P>

<P>We stayed on St.Mary's, which was a new experience for me. We spent the first day wandering round the south half of the island and getting a feel for it all. One of the great features of the islands are the crazily sculpted granite outcrops. This is <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/pulpit-rock-1.jpg">Sarah</A> clambering around on <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/pulpit-rock-2.jpg"><I>the Pulpit Rock</I></A>. Further round, we got great views back over <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/church-point.jpg">Peninnis</A>. The tide was out in Porth Hellick when <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/scillonian-III.jpg">the <I>Scillonian</I></A> came around the headland. Another great rock feature is <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/loaded-camel.jpg">the Loaded Camel</A> at Porth Hellick. We finished off our round island walk <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/sarah-jane-1.jpg">on the beach</A> by <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/tolls-island.jpg">Tolls Island</A>.This was <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/paul-nets.jpg">plan B</A> if the accommodation hadn't worked out.</P>

<P>There are lots of things that make the Scillies feel unique. One of them is the incredible variety of plant life that's become naturalised to the islands.</P>

<P>Later that night we went for dinner at the excellent <A HREF="http://www.the-boatshed.co.uk/">Boat Shed</A>. The girls from <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/bonnet.jpg">the Bonnet crew</A> were warming up for the next <A HREF="http://www.scillyonline.co.uk/gigs.html">gig race</A>. Finished off the night watching <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/norrard-rocks.jpg">the sun go down</A> from the Garrison.</P>

<P>We had planned to do some island hopping by sea kayak, but there was a pretty decent swell, so we took the opportunity to island hop on one of the little island boats. We started off on Bryher, then nipped over to Tresco for a look at Cromwells Castle. The views from the north end were great:</P>

<P>There's a lot of wildlife on the Scillies:</P>

<P>We found an excellent guy called Murray at  <A HREF="http://www.kayakscilly.com/http://www.kayakscilly.com/">Kayak Scilly</A> who was happy to rent us sea kayaks for the day. So we waited for the calmest day<A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/hugh-town-2.jpg"> to dawn</A> and set off! It was <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/sarah-jane-4.jpg">a little tense</A> to begin with as we got used to it. Even with a slight force 3, there was still a decent swell out in The Roads as we made our way across to Sansom. the conditions coming into Sansom were amazing. <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/sarah-kayaks.AVI">Clear blue water</A> and hardly a wave. We pulled <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/sea-yaks.jpg">the Seayaks</A> out onto the beach and just <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/paul-beach.jpg">wandered around</A> searching for shells for quite a while. After we'd had enough of our own private island, we headed up to Bryher for lunch, then back to Hugh Town. 13 kilometers in all, I think <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/sarah-jane-5.jpg">we all enjoyed it</A>.</P>

<P>Next day we wandered round the north end of St Mary's, starting from <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/hugh-town-3.jpg">Hugh Town</A>. The views back to Hugh Town from <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/hugh-town-4.jpg">above Juliet's Garden</A> were great. The Scillies are full of ancient remains, and the burial grounds at <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/bants-carn.jpg">Bant's Carn</A> are among the oldest. <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/sarah-jane-6.jpg">Beachcombing</A> was a regular event.</P>

<P>The last day arrived with a ghostly mist over Hugh Town. We thought we were stranded for a while as the airport was closed down. But the sun came through eventually and we took off for our <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/porth-hellick.jpg">last views</A> of the islands. We had a nice <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/brokken-chopper.jpg">brokken spectre</A> effect on the way back and great views of the Cornish coastline (<A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/mousehole.jpg">Mousehole</A> and <A HREF="../images/Scillies-07/st-michaels-mount.jpg">St Michaels Mount</A>).</P>
