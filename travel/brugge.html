</DIV>

<P>Most of this trip was about our taking part in the <A HREF="../biking/flanders-07.html">Tour of Flanders sportif</A>.</P>

<P>After watching the Classic <A HREF="http://www.rvv.be/">Ronde van Vlaanderen</A> on the Sunday, we drove to <A HREF="../images/Brugge/brugge-07-01.jpg">Brugge</A>.</P>

<P>Nice place Brugge. <A HREF="../images/Brugge/brugge-07-02.jpg">Lovely old centre</A> surrounded by <A HREF="../images/Brugge/brugge-07-04.jpg">a canal</A> and lots of fabulous medieval buildings. City gates and <A HREF="../images/Brugge/brugge-07-03.jpg">windmills on the ramparts</A>. Pretty unique.</P>

<P>We were in town over the easter weekend and they really go in for it i a big way. More bunnies and chicks than you can point a delicious plain chocolate stick at.</P>

<P>I was feeling a bit rubbish on the Saurday night - combination of too much sun/beer and onset of a bug, so I crashed out in the hostel. Rest of the guys went out and had a meal, but everyone was a bit wiped, so no night clubs that night.</P>

<P>Next morning we were all heading off, but we had a near crisis as I couldn't find the car keys. It was Easter Monday, so getting a spare key was impossible. Took me ages to find the key. Fortunately Sarah had stashed it in a safe place. Phew, what a relief; thanks Sarah ;o)</P>
