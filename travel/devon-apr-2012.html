<P>It was time to take the plunge and go on holiday with the outlaws. We found what turned out to be <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%201.jpg">this perfect little cottage</a> down in the hamlet of <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%202.jpg">Bucks Mills</a>.</P>

<p>Day one was spent down on the beach getting the hang of <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%203.jpg">running away from waves</a> and <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%204.jpg">chucking sand</a>!</p>

<p>The weather was generally great, but on day 2, the heavens opened. Fortunately there was an activity park nearby where, among other things, Patrick got some <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%205.jpg">good tips on archery</a>. We could come to regret that.</p>

<p><a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%206.jpg">Clovelly</a> is a lovelly little village that <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%207.jpg">tumbles down the cliff</a> into the sea. Like Bucks Mills, there's <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%208.jpg">a nice waterfall</a> and a lovely beach to <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%200412%209.jpg">muck about on</a>. Grandma was happy with <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041210.jpg">the little lanes</a> down on the sea front, but she jumped in the Land Rover for <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041211.jpg">the climb back up the hill</a>.</p>

<p>There's a donkey ride up at the top of the village and Bryher was <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041212.jpg">very serious</a> about getting kitted out. They were both <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041213.jpg">great at hanging on</a> and <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041214.jpg">looked after their steeds</a> - Jasper and Jakie.</p>


<p>And so we spent the week. Going fishing <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041215.jpg">here</a> and <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041218.jpg">there</a>, <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041216.jpg">mucking about</a> the cottage, a really lovely <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041217.jpg">trip to Lundy</a> 
(where we'll return), <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041219.jpg">cream teas in Appledore</a> and mucking about on <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041220.jpg">the beach at Westward Ho!</a></p>

<p>And when it drew to a close on <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041221.jpg">a lovely sunny day in April</a>, we just had time for <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041222.jpg">one more walk</a> along <a href="../images/UK/buck%20mills%20041223.jpg">the cliffs at Clovelly</a>.</p>
