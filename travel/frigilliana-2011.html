<P>We decided to have a weeks break down in Spain at Gerry and Caroline's flat in Frigilliana. Flights from Bristol to Malaga, hire car, speeding ticket and we rocked up to the flat in the middle of the night with the kids fast asleep.</P>

<p>It turned into a really lovely trip. This is first picture of <a href="../images/Family/frigilliana-0511-01.jpg">Patrick and Bryher playing on the beach</a> together. <a href="../images/Family/frigilliana-0511-02.jpg">Mummy was there too :)</a></p>

<p>Frigilliana is a lovely little village. There are walks that you can do from the village centre and one day, we headed up the river gorge that snakes round below the village. Patrick had great fun stripping off and <a href="../images/Family/frigilliana-0511-03.jpg">splashing in the cool clear water</a>. He was less impressed when <a href="../images/Family/frigilliana-0511-04.jpg">he fell head first in it </a>a little later on!</p>

<p>There was <a href="../images/Family/frigilliana-0511-05.jpg">a wonderful fiesta</a> down in Nerja while we were there. Very local and authentic. Lots of caballos on horseback and ox cart. Patrick was most impressed at the tractor collection.</p>

<p>What made the break extra special was that Caroline, Shell and Ash all came out as well, to celebrate Caroline's birthday with a bunch of her mates. Sharing the flat with Shell and Ash was great fun and the kids loved it. And decorating the finca for Caroline's arrival was great fun too.</p>

<p>All in all, <a href="../images/Family/frigilliana-0511-06.jpg">a great trip</a> and I'm sure we'll go back.</p>
