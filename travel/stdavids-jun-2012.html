</DIV>

<P>It was 2012. The year of the Olympics. The year Bradley won the Tour. The year of the Diamond Jubilee. And a very good excuse to go for a lovely bit of camping over the long Jubilee weekend.</P>

<p>We decided to head West to St Davids. With Steve and Beth's wedding coming up, Pembrokeshire seemed to have a natural attraction. </p>

<p>It was <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-03.jpg">a great turn out</a>. Dave & Jules came down from Yorkshire and got some sea cliff climbing in. Raph brought <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-07.jpg">Benjy to keep Bryher company</a>. Steve & Rose came down and did some great paddling. Steve and Beth were there of course, but <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-05.jpg">Beth's Mum & Dad joined in the fun</a> and got to meet all the faces.</p>

<p>The campsite couldn't have been better - Caerfai Farm it's called. They make sure the field doesn't get too busy, so there's enough room for <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-02.jpg">the kids to muck about</a>. All the organic croissants had obviously given Patrick <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-06.jpg">a lot of energy</a>. And all the running about <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-04.jpg">gave Bryher a thirst</a>. And when the sun went down and the moon came up, there was <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-01.jpg">all sorts of wildlife</a> creeping about.</p>

<p>The campsite sits right on the Pembroke Coast path, immediately above Caerfai Bay. It's a lovely rocky bay and beach, with a broad sandy belt running up to the cliffs. The first day was glorious, so we piled down to the beach and got straight in. Steve, Jas and Ash were there as well and <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-08.jpg">Patrick and Ash</a> had great fun. Bryher <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-09.jpg">wasn't going to miss out</a>.</p>


<p>Beth  had brought some body boards down, so everyone had a go. <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-11.jpg">Ash loved it</a>. <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-10.jpg">So did Patrick</a>, despite getting properly dunked in at one point. <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-12.jpg">Beth showed us</a> all how to do it. And <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-13.jpg">I finally got the hang of it</a>. After all the exercise, it was time for <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-14.jpg">a bit of chillin</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-19.jpg">Sue and the kids</a> came down and did some coasteering and Will, Jo, Ian and Helen made the group complete. We even <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-18.jpg">got a ride in</a>!</p>

<p>We had lots of lovely meals and walks and rides and climbs and paddles and <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-16.jpg">a good time was had by all</a>. There's <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-15.jpg">lots of enthusiasm </a>to do it again next year. And maybe we won't be <a href="../images/UK/caerfai-0612-17.jpg">the only ones with a van </a>by then :)</p>
