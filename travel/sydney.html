<P>I arrived in Sydney on 24 March</P>

<P>If you plan to visit, there's no need to book accommodation up-front. Roll into the arrivals hall at Sydney airport and stop at the Traveller's Services desk. They arrange standby accommodation with big discounts at all the top hotels in the town. We are in the <I>Four Points</I> on <A HREF="../images/Sydney/darling_harbour.jpg">Darling Harbour</A> and it's great :o)</P>

<P>Spent the first day getting the feel of the place. Wandered through the parks, and then up to Circular Quay to see the iconic <A HREF="../images/Sydney/opera_house.jpg">Opera House</A> and <A HREF="../images/Sydney/harbour_bridge.jpg">Harbour Bridge</A>. The Botanic Gardens are well worth a visit. First park I've seen with signs that read, "Please Walk On the Grass", very refreshing; as is <A HREF="../images/Sydney/pool.jpg">the pool</A>. We ended up back downtown in the <A HREF="../images/Sydney/qvb.jpg">Queen Victoria Building</A> for a bit of retail therapy.</P>

<P>If anyone fancies a new job, they're looking for a partner for <A HREF="../images/Sydney/cleaning_opera_house.jpg">this bloke</A>.</P>


<P>They still seem to bring <A HREF="../images/Sydney/chain_gang.jpg">convicts</A> into Sydney. Dressed in their grey outfits, chained to each other and to the bridge, they are forced to march up and down the bridge all day long. I decided to skip the bridge tour and go lounge around in a terrace bar with a <A HREF="../images/Sydney/harbour_view.jpg">harbour view</A> for some lunch.</P>

<P>That evening we watched Rossini's <I>Cinderella</I> at the opera house. It seemed just the right thing to do.</P>

<P>Next day was Manly on the ferry (thanks for the tip Dawn). Great trip over there. This is <A HREF="../images/Sydney/manly_beach.jpg">the beach</A>. I walked the Manly to Spit (sic) trail. The walk is nicer than it sounds with views into all the <A HREF="../images/Sydney/clontarf.jpg">little coves</A> on the north shore. Even this close to the city, there's plenty of <A HREF="../images/Sydney/dragon.jpg">wildlife</A>. </P>

<P>Anti-war demo's against the Iraw War continue across Australia. <A HREF="../images/Sydney/sydney_demo.jpg">This one outside John Howard's office in Sydney</A> cut up ugly with punches, chairs and bottles being thown. The crowd was made up of a few thousand high-school students with a noticeable contingent of Australian-Iraqis who obviouslly find themselves in a difficult position.</P>


<P>[Old] Joke of the week comes with thanx to Hoppy.</P>

<P>"With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person which almost  went unnoticed earlier in February.
Larry LaPrise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Kokey" died peacefully at the age of  93.
The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin.
They put his left leg in... and then the trouble started."</P>
