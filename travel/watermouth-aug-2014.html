<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Watermouth, Summer 2014</H1>
</DIV>

<P>During August we headed down to the North Devon coast and pitched up at Watermouth Bay just east of Ilfracombe. We were trying out <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/pitch.jpg">our new awning</a> and it worked really well. We got a tie down strap, which was just as well as the wind was crazy all week. </P>

<p>Another summer, another beach, <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/ilfracombe-beach.jpg">another great day for Patrick & Bryher</a> down in the sand and surf :) Meanwhile I got to <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/kite.jpg">go fly a kite</a> over Ilfracombe.</p>

<p>Just a short walk from the camp site, was this quirky little place called Watermouth Castle. A Victorian folly built as a wedding gift for a young bride, it had been turned over the past 40 years by one family into a slightly odd, but <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/plane-ride.jpg">great fun venue</a>.</p>

<p>Damien Hirst has a connection with this place. <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/verity.jpg">This little beauty </a>is his understated donation to the town council. He calls it <i>Verity</i></p>

<p>We headed out for a day trip on a little fishing boat. <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/boat-ride.jpg">Kids had great fun</a> bouncing around in the surf.</p>

<p>On the way home, we stopped off at Lynmouth and went up the <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/lynmouth-funicular.jpg">funicular</a> to Lynton. <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/lynmouth-bay.jpg">Great views</a> of the bay and <a href="../images/Watermouth-14/bryher-ice-cream.jpg">a memorable ice-cream</a> at the top :)</p>
