</DIV>

    

<p>Towards the end of October, Patrick was privileged to go on the year 11 school trip to Greece. It doesn't feel like that long since we were all in Greece, but actually it was 7 years ago. Patrick remembers a lot from that visit. This trip would be centred around Athens. Each day was packed with activity. Day one was a trip to the wonderful <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-7.jpeg">site of Delphi</a>, which turned out to be Patricks favourite. Some <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-8.jpeg">nice wildlife</a> and <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-9.jpeg">a great museum</a> apparently. </p>
    
    
<p>The next day took them to the Peleponnese, crossing the wonderful <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-1.jpeg">Corinth Canal</a>. This day woud be spent at Mycenae. They walked through the legendary <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-2.jpeg">Lion Gate</a> and visited one of the <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-3.jpeg"beehive tombs, also known as a <i>tholos</i> tomb. After passing through the <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-4.jpeg">vast entrance portal</a> with massive carved blocks, the interior is roofed with a <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-5.jpeg">false domed ceiling</a> constructed using corbelling. </p>
    
    
<p>The last full day was spent around the Acropolis, visiting the famous Acropolis Museum and, of course, seeing <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-6.jpeg">the Parthenon</a> - nice scaffold! Sadly there was no crazy static in the Acroplis Museum this time. Their final day was spent with a little walking around Athens and then back on the plane to London and the bus back to Cheltenham.</p>
