<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Corfe Castle, April 2021</H1>
</DIV>

<P>We had been in lockdown all winter, but I gambled that it would get relaxed around Easter, so we booked some time off and managed to find a lovely little cottage in Corfe Castle, in the Purbecks, a part of Dorset we had never been to before.</P>

<p>There was an amazing amount to do in a relatively small area, and something for all the family. Fossil hunting on the Jurassic Coast for Sarah, steam trains for Moss, amusement arcades in Swanage for Patrick and Bryher and lots of lovely wild places to see wildlife, like the RSPB reserve at Arne for me. </p>

<p>We stayed in a  lovely little place called Stone Cottage on West Street. England was just starting to open up and I was able to enjoy  a first pint in the garden of the Fox Inn. <img src="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-01.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="First pint in the garden of the Fox Inn, Corfe Castle.">. </p>

<p>We had taken all the bikes and from the cottage I could ride up onto the gorse covered Corfe Common to the south of the village. This was a really lovely spot and the gorse was glowing brightly in the spring sunshine. There were Roe Deer and lots of birdlife. Looking north from the common lies <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-02.jpg">Corfe Castle</a>, a ragged but prominent landmark above the ancient village and region it once ruled.</p>

<p>We were really lucky with the weather this early in the season and we made the most of it.  We spent a lovely day <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-03.jpg">at Kimmeridge Cove</a>. The Etches Collection private fossil museum was still closed, due to covid, so that one will need to wait for another day. But the coast is always open and we had great fun rock pooling and finding wonderful fossils all along the beach here.</p>

<p>The <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-04.jpg">Swanage Steam Railway</a> passes right through Corfe Castle and was walking distance from our cottage. We were able to use it as our commute down into Swanage :) Everyone loved it, but perhaps Moss especially :)</p>

 
<p>The Purbecks have a fabulous history that spans right up to recent times. During World War 2, the coast here was used to practice for the invasion of Normandy. Exactly 77 years earlier, in April 1944, the allies were preparing for the invasion, and Operation SMASH was an enormous live fire exercise that happened on this section of the Dorset Coast. <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-05.jpg">Fort Henry</a> was constructed both as a defensive site, but also to  afford the visiting dignitaries - Winston Churchill, Dwight D. Eisenhower and King George the VI - to safely view the enormous amount of live fire that rained down on the troops making their final preparations. Sadly for some, the preparations were as deadly as the real thing, and the first trial of the amphibious Duplex Valentine Tanks ended with 6 of them sinking to the sea bed, along with some of their crew.</p>

<p>This part of the coast is nonetheless still a natural wonder, largely due to the  private and conservative nature of the historic landowners, the Bankes Family. The Bankeses were the main family in this region from the 16th century right up to the 20th. They owned Corfe Castle and most of Studland. When the last member of the family died, they left the castle and the Studland peninsula to the National Trust. This is <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-06.jpg">Shell Bay</a>, right at the end of the peninsula.</p>

<p>It what may now be a tradition, we rented a fishing boat and got out on the water for <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-07.jpg">some boat fishing.</a>  Everyone <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-08.jpg">got a rod</a>. The good news is that <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-09.jpg">everyone caught something</a> and had fun. It was mainly Lesser Dogfish, but Patrick also caught a Starry Smoothhound, I caught a Thornback Ray and Sarah hooked a really big Conger Eel, which bit through the line, just as we were hauling it into the boat!!</p>

    <p>The Purbeck's are sometimes known as <i>the Ingrained Isle</i>, and I certainly look forward to <a href="../images/Corfe%20Castle%2021/corfe-castle-10.jpg">coming back again one day</a>.</p>
