<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>An ambition fulfilled, Fair Isle, September 2025</H1>
</DIV>

<p>All my life I had been interested in wildlife, especially birds. And for every birder of my generation, Fair Isle was the magnetic north of British Birding. But since moving south and starting a family, like many things, birding was something that happened when the opportunity presented, rather than as a thing in itself. But in 2025, I moved to partial retirement and reduced hours, so I decided that I would make the space to fulfill a lifetime ambition and go to Fair Isle.</p>

<p>Logistically, Fair Isle is not an easy place to get to at any time. The weather often plays a hand. So as I prepared to head north I kept an eye on the weather forecast and sure enough, a storm was forecast for the morning of my flight from Shetland at the end of September. I had driven to Glasgow in the van on the Wednesday and stayed the night with Maureen and Gerry. As I flew north from Glasgow to Shetland, I decided to bring my flight to Fair Isle forward a day.</p>


<p>That all proved very wise. <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-01.jpeg">I made it to Fair Isle</a> on the Thursday, but as it turned out, all flights were cancelled for the next 3 days! The only way to get to Fair Isle is via Shetland. I hadn't been there either and it was lovely to see the place. I hope to return there one day for a longer trip.</p>


<p>The famous <a href="https://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk">Fair Isle Bird Observatory</a> had been completely destroyed in an awful fire in 2019. All the difficulties of Covid and all the challenges of construction on Britain's remotest inhabited island had meant that 'the Obs' had only reopened this year. I was super happy to get to stay there in its inaugural season.</p>


<p>I was picked up from the landing strip by Steve Holgate who runs the catering and dropped at the Obs. On walking into the lounge, i was delighted to find <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-02.jpeg">a Barred Warbler</a> happily scoffing apples just outside the window.</p> 
    
    
<p>I was only going to be on Fair Isle for a few days and I was keen to take advantage of everything the observatory had to offer. this turned into a regular routine of the early morning visit with the wardens to check the various heligoland traps, <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-07.jpeg">watching them ringing </a>anything interesting and going on a couple of organised walks with Carla the island ranger. </p>

<p>The first of those walks with Carla was around the north end of the island. We passed a few of the <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-03.jpeg">lovely little wire puffins</a> that one of the island's resident artists had put in place. As it was late in the season, this would be the only Puffin I would see :) We walked up to the North Light (with a Turtle Dove fly by). From that end, you can look west to teh STacks of Skroo and see the <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-04.jpeg">thousands of Gannet</a> still resident there.</p>
    
<p>In my own time, I wandered south around the island. I found the <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-05.jpeg">remains of the crashed Heinkel</a>. Strange that on the two islands I had been on recently, each would have its own crashed Heinkel story. The outcome of the crew of the Fair Isle plane was much more positive than for those on Lundy. </p>
    
    
<p>Knowing that my bird identification skills would be a bit rubbish compareed to some of the other birders on the island that week, I had decided to invest ina camera, with a decent long lens, so that when I did see something i couldn't identify, I would hopefully get a picture for someone else to ID. this worked well, but it wa also great fun getting good shots of <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-06.jpeg">commoner birds</a> as well as some <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-12.jpeg">stunning scenery shots</a>. </p>
    
<p>But birding had been the main reason for this trip, so what else did I see:</p>
    
    <li>this <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-08.jpeg">lovely Red-backed Shrike</a></li>
    <li>a gorgeous <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-09.jpeg">male Brambling</a> in the hand, with a chance to see all eth colours you normally can't in the field</li>
    <li>best views ever of <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-10.jpeg">a Hawfinch</a> in the Observatory garden</li>
    <li>this <a href="../images/Fair-Isle-25/fair-isle-0925-11.jpeg">juvernile Sparrowhawk</a>, with a full crop from its earlier meal of a Song Thrush!</li>
    
<p>Fair Isle had been a magical place to visit and hadn't disappointed. There were no national rarities the week I was there, it wasn't the right weather conditions. But it had been a complete joy to make my own way around the island, find my own birds and soak up the atmosphere of one of Britain's oldest, newest and best bird observatories :)</p>
