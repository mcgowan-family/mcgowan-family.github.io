<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>North Island, New Zealand</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Referee!!! I am guttted at the snow days we are missing in DC. Looks like the best conditions in the past 10 years. Hopefully you're all getting plenty of biking and skiing in. Back to the plot.</P>

<P>We arrived in Auckland on 11 Feb.</P>

<P>New Zealand must be one of the most visually stunning countries to approach from the air. A mixture of mountains and pastureland, aquamarine waters, islands scattered across the Hauraki Gulf and crinkle-cut coastline stretching off into the distance.</P>

<P>We picked up our campervan from the airport and headed north. Spent the first night at <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/waipu.jpg">Waipu Cove</A> and sampled the delights of swimming in a big ocean again. Don't worry, no pictures of questionable swimgear :o) For those following hot on our heels, we can recommend <I>Waipu Cove Cottages and Camping</I>.</P>

<P>From Waipu, we kept heading north to the Bay of Islands. Of course we couldn't pass through Kawakawa without checking out the legendary <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/bogs.jpg">public conveniences</A> designed by the recently deceased Friedensreich Hundertwasser. </P>

<P>Having paid our respects, we kept on to the Bay of Islands. To get a sense for how amazing this area is you've got to get out on the water. First stop is likely to be the lovely little town of <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/russell.jpg">Russell</A>, across the water from the slightly brassier Paihia. Visit the the <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/hole_in_the_rock.jpg">Hole in the Rock</A>, or spend a night on one of the <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/bay_of_islands.jpg">many islands</A> scattered across the Bay.</P>

<P>We spent the night on a little island connected to the mainland by a causeway (Aroha Island) -it is also a Kiwi refuge. I'd love to link to a picture of one of the little buggers, but Kiwi tracking is a bit like Haggis hunting. You know they're out there, but try finding anyone who's actually seen one! I eventually tracked one down in the full dark of the night and caught a glimpse as it legged it across the trail in front of me. Of course it could have been a Rhode Island Red with a darning needle duct taped to its head, but I prefer to think that it was a North Island Kiwi.</P>

<P>From the Bay, we winged down the west coast and spent the night at the delightful <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/wenderholm.jpg">Wenderholm Town Park</A> just north of Auckland. Another great swimming spot.</P>

<P>The next day was spent on Tiri Tiri Matangi island. This is an open sanctuary that enables you to experience what the mainland was like before the extinction of much of the native birdlife. Just for Michelle, here's a picture of a couple of <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/takahe.jpg">Takahe</A> that I snapped there.</P>

<P>We headed back down to Auckland to catch the first couple of races of the much anticipated America's Cup race. The country held its breath in the days leading up to the first race when the much fancied challenger, Team Alinghi, with the unbeaten pairing of Coutts and Butterworth, would take on the untried Team New Zealand in the Black Boat. The atmosphere the night before in the Viaduct harboour was electric. The massive Millenium Cup yachts looked on, as <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/viaduct.jpg">last minute preps</A> took place under lights in the Alinghi and Team New Zealand docks. <P>

</P>No one predicted the outcome of the first race, which saw Team New Zealand ship a lot of water in the first 10 minutes, then snap the end of the boom and have a titanium jib tack disentegrate within the next 5 minutes. The crowd at Viaduct Harbour gave NZL 82 a typically loyal welcome <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/nzl82.jpg">as it limped back in under tow</A>.
</P>

<P>The second and third races have also gone to Alinghi and the pressure is now on to stop them making a clean sweep of the best of 9 race final.</P>

<P>If you fancy some veggie fare, get yourself up to Musical Knives on Ponsonby Avenue (take the Link bus from Downtown). The chef (Peter Chaplin) earned his spurs cooking for groups on the road and Chrissy Hynde set him up as Madonna's personnel chef for a while ... and the food's pretty decent too. Other options include a host of places along Ponsonby and Parnell Street. All accessible via the link.</P>

<P>Next stop was the volcanically active area of Rotorua and the big draw of the <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/lady_knox.jpg">Lady Knox geyser</A>.</P>

<P>We made our way down to Wellington, via the Tongariro national Park, and spent the night at Carl's place. Of course, we had to see <I>Two Towers</I> in Peter Jackson's home cinema -  the Embassy (Lin was less convinced of this, but was good enough to humour me). Wellington is a lovely city with a great waterfront, good bars (Mark should try <I>Molly Malone's </I>on Courtenay Place for live Irish folk music), good restaurants and the fantastic museum of Te Papa. The museum just happens to have a <I>Lord of the Rings</I> exhibit on, so we all went to see that as well. It was sad to spend so little time with Carl but great to catch up in the time that we had. Many thanks to Kirsten for letting us crash in her lovely little garden cottage. We said cheerio to <A HREF="../images/North%20Island/carl.jpg">Carl</A> on the docks and look forward to meeting up in the not too distant future.</P>
