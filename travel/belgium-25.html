<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>A Spring break to Brugges and Ghent April 2025</H1>
</DIV>

<p>Sarah had wanted to visit Brugges for a long time, and this spring felt like a good time to do that. We decided on the boat rather than tunnel, as it had been a while since the kids had <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-01.jpeg">been on the sea</a>.</p>

<p>We stayed at a wonderful little guesthouse called <a href="https://www.bellevieguesthouse.be/en/">the Belle Vie</a>, in Moerbrugge, just south-east of Brugge. It was owned by a guy called Filip Godderis. At the last minute the Lads decided to join the trip, which was great fun :)</p>

<p>As Brugges was the initial inspiration, that's where we spent our first day. We parked up by the railway station to the south of the old city and walked through the wonderful historic districts to get a feel for the place. Belgium is 'bike land'. I loved this underground parking, <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-02.jpeg">just for bikes</a>.</p>


<p>The walking had worked up an appetite, so we popped into our new favourite pastry cafe, <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-03.jpeg">Aux Merveilleux</a>! Not sure if it was the sugar or the fact we were on holiday, but Moss was <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-04.jpeg">wonderfully excited</a>!</p>


<p>The Lads arrived later that morning, having caught a later boat and joined us at <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-05.jpeg">the Opus Latino cafe</a>, just behind the Basilica of the Holy Blood. After some lunch we went back up to the Basilica. In some ways I preferred the more ancient Romanesque style of St.Basils Chapel immediately below the Basilica. Most folk walk right past it, but it is <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-06.jpeg">a more contemplative space</a>.</p>


<p>There was a lot more wndering around. This is <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-07.jpeg">inside the beer museum</a>. A few nice McEwans signs up there. One of the many local breweries, is <a href="https://www.bourgognedesflandres.be/en">Bourgognes des Flandres</a>. So when we came across their brewery, <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-08.jpeg">we had to go in</a>. Patrick was very happy that the <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-09.jpeg">legal age for drinking beer</a> in Belgium is 16 :)</p> 
    
    
<p>A few folk had said that Ghent was certainly worth a look and they weren't wrong. We <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-11.jpeg">headed over on the train</a>, which is always fun in itself. This is <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-12.jpeg">most of the gang</a>.</p>

<p>Ghent is much larger than Brugges and it's a longish walk in from the train station. The centre is dominated by <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-17.jpeg">these three huge structures</a> - St.Nicholas's CHurch, the Belfry and St.Bavo's Cathedral.</p>
    
<p>Me and Patrick went up the Belfry. This is <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-13.jpeg">the Cloth Hall</a> inside. The Belfry has a huge, gilded dragon on top as a weather vane. The dragon is Buccoleon, <a href="https://sacred-texts.com/etc/tl/tl08.htm">read about him here</a>. <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-14.jpeg">An older version</a> is stored in one of the huge tower rooms. Near the top of the tower is an enormous carillon. This is <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-15.jpeg">the 'score'</a> of the carillon. The view from the top of the Belfry of <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-16.jpeg">St.Bavo's</a> was wonderful.</p>     

<p>After all that climbing, it was time for lunch. We found a great little sushi place right behind the Belfry, called <a href="https://www.tokyosushi.be/">Tokyo Sushi</a>. The kids absolutely <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-10.jpeg">loved it</a> :)</p>
    
    
<p>Ghent, like Brugges, has canals and rivers running through and <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-21.jpeg">a boat trip</a> is a great way to see some of the more historic buildings. We enjoyed the Ghent one more, but it probably depends what guide you get as much as anything. This the <i>Gravensteen</i>, the <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-18.jpeg">Castle of the Counts</a>.</p>
    
<p>The next day, me and Patrick rented a couple of bikes from Filip at the Belle Vie and rode into Brugge. It was a really lovely way to get into and around the city and we both enjoyed it enormously. This is Patrick <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-19.jpeg">crossing the Conzettbrug</a>.We rode up to see the windmills as the sun was setting. This is <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-20.jpeg">the Sint-Janhuismolen</a>.</p>
    
<p>But soon it was time to head back. We made the most of the last morning by heading to the impressive wetlands reserve <a href="https://www.zwin.be/en">at Het Zwin</a>. It is very reminiscent of a WWT reserve, but even more well done, in terms of the interpretive displays in the centre. Zwin was where <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-23.jpeg">White Stork</a> were first re-introduced to Belgium in the 1960s, after an absence of 100 years. A lovely surprise was finding <a href="../images/Belgium-25/belgium-0425-22.jpeg">Tree Frog </a>(known as Boomkikker in Flemish) in the Brambles there.</p>
