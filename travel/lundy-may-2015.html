<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Lundy, Spring 2015</H1>
</DIV>

<P>We had visited Lundy for a day a couple of years ago, and decided that it would be great to spend longer staying in one of the lovely Landmark Trust properties. So last year, we booked a week in May and crossed our fingers for good weather. But first we had to get there ...</P>

<p>There are two routes to Lundy. When it blows a storm, a helicopter goes from Hartland Point, but when it's fair, <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/family-oldenburg.jpg">the MV Oldenburg</a> sails from Bideford or Ilfracombe. Now Sarah was 5 months pregnant, so she was hoping for the 'copter, but as luck would have it, the seas were very mild and we had <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/patrick-rope.jpg">a lovely crossing</a>.</p>

<p>We all piled off onto the harbour and made our way up the harbour road towards the few houses that make up the only thing you might call a village on Lundy.  We were in the company of a large group of around 20 Indians from Hyderabad. It made for a slightly odd sight and had the feeling of a pilgrimage, in an odd sort of way.</p>

<p>Once at the Marisco Tavern, we registered at the island office and made our way up to <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/stoneycroft.jpg">Stoneycroft</a>; our home for the next week. Stoneycroft was the accommodation used to house the lighthouse inspectors when they visited the island back in the 19th century. As such, it sits right below the fabulous <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/lighthouse.jpg">Old Light.</a>. I was delighted to find that the light house was open and we could scamper up to the lantern room and take in what was a literally breath taking view. Fortunately there were <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/lighthouse-chairs.jpg">a couple of chairs</a> to catch your breath and savour the view in comfort.</p>

<p>To keep kids and adults busy while on the island, they run a letter box treasure hunt. Little boxes are stashed all over the island and you need to follow clues to track them down, stamp your book and claim your certificate at the end of the week. <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/girls-lighthouse.jpg">We set off</a> on the first night in search of our first letter box.</p>

<p>Next day found us tracking down another one at <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/the-battery.jpg">the derelict Battery</a>.</p>

<p>But there was plenty of time to just muck about in the garden. <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/girls-knitting.jpg">Quality time</a> for the girls. Not forgetting to have <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/garden-picnic.jpg">a garden picnic.</a>. I even found a <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/gbb-eggs.jpg">Great Black Backed Gull's nest</a>. </p>

<p>The island is pretty small - just 5km long and 1 km at its widest. There aren't many beaches and most of those are dangerous to reach, but the one down by the harbour is a lovely spot for <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/beach-picnic.jpg">a beach picnic</a>. We even did some <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/stupah.jpg">beach art</a>. But then it was time to wind our way back up the road, through <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/millicombe.jpg">Millicombe Valley</a>, back home.</p>

<p>The small number of properties on the island are all owned and managed by the Landmark Trust; a charity that restores historic buildings and maintains them by renting them out. Great idea and this was its 50th Anniversary. To mark the occasion they commissioned Anthony Gormley to create a small number of art installations at four Trust sites around the UK; <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/gormley.jpg">one of these</a> is on the southern tip of Lundy.</p>

<p>Back in the Victorian era, the HMS Montagu foundered on the rocks just below this statue. A massive salvage operation was put in place to save as much as possible from the wreck and as part of that, a set of stairs and an amazing aerial walkway was created to take the salvage crew out to the wreck. <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/montagu-3.jpg">The stairs</a> remain, but the walkway is long gone. I scampereed down to have a look at <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/montagu-1.jpg">the churning waves</a> and you can certainly see why <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/montagu-2.jpg">they had to act fast </a>to salvage the wreck.</p>

<p>The southern end of the island is looked over by <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/south-light.jpg">the South Light</a> that sits just above Rat Island and the jetty. It was <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/selfie-castle.jpg">another sunny day</a>,  so we were out looking for letter boxes at Marisco Castle, but generally <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/selfie-castle-2.jpg">just mucking about</a>. <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/hamners.jpg">Hamners</a> is another of the Landmark Trust properties down at the south end, but with amazing views up the eastern terrace of Lundy.</p>

<p>At the end of each day, we'd <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/bryher-field-light.jpg">trog back through the fields</a> to our wee cottage below the great Old Light. And as the sun set, we had a last look out from <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/lower-light.jpg">the lower light room</a> which was being restored.</p>

<p>One day, we climbed up <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/spiral-stairs.jpg">the long flight of spiral stairs</a> inside the Old Light. Amazingly it's possible to get outside at the top, and with quite  a lot of nervousness, we went out onto <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/balcony.jpg">the balcony</a> outside the lantern room at the top (you need to get a key from the island office)! Everyone agreed that while that was very exciting, it felt <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/kids-lantern-room.jpg">much safer indoors</a>. But <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/stoneycroft-graveyard.jpg">the view out over Stoneycroft</a>, and the rest of the island, was amazing.</p>

<p>All good things come to an end, and finally it was time to <a href="../images/Lundy%202015/heading-home.jpg">get back on the Oldenburg</a> and head back to the mainland. We were the only family to get all the letterboxes and Patrick and Bryher were rightfully proud of their certificates. I'm sure we'll be back on Lundy one day.</p>
