<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Summer Road Trip, Scotland 2022</H1>
</DIV>

<p>In what may become an annual event, the boys decided to go on <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-1.jpeg">a summer road trip</a> in the van to Scotland.</p>

<p>A long haul north, with a lovely route over the border, led to our first stop at Coldstream, where we met up with <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-2.jpeg">all the Metivier cousins</a> in their new caravan!</p>

<p>Patrick has been doing his Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award this year. For the physical component, he selected mountain biking and I was blown away by how much he improved in only 3 months. It also meant we had lots of great Saturday mornings in the Forest of Dean together, just the two of us. As a fitting finale, he finished off in my old stomping ground <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-3.jpeg">at Glen Tress</a>!</p>


<p>After a short stop on the drive at Maureen & Gerry's, we travelled North again, making a slight detour to take in <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-4.jpeg">the Falkirk Wheel</a> and <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-5.jpeg">the Kelpies</a>. A new thing this summer, is that Patrick has developed an aversion to being photographed. Increasingly he appears behind the camera, rather than in front of it.</p>


 
    
<p>Next stop was <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-6.jpeg">a nice little lay up</a> alongside Loch an Eillein. Gerry had joined us in his van by this point.This is <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-7.jpeg">one of my favourite spots</a> in one of my favourite places; the Rothiemurchus. There's <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-8.jpeg">a nice little trail</a> around that you can bike. <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-9.jpeg">Everyone loved it</a> and we'll definitely be back</p>


<p>We headed further north past Inverness, stopping briefly at <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-10.jpeg">the wonderful Corrieshalloch Gorge</a>, through <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-11.jpeg">Ullapool</a> and then on to what would be a few days laid up in Lochinver, under the at times <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-12.jpeg">brooding presence of Suilven</a> :)</p>
    
    
<p>After <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-13.jpeg">a hearty van breakfast</a>, we started a wonderful few days by visiting <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-14.jpeg">the beach at Clachtoll</a>. It turns out there was a sandcastle competition and we won <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-15.jpeg">best artistic castle</a>, for one of our 'dribble castles'! Then it was back to Lochinver for <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-16.jpeg">a spot of fishing</a>. As usual Gerry caught more fish than me (young Pollack), but <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-17.jpeg">Patrick was doing well too</a> :)</p>
    
    
    
<p>I had been telling the kids the story of the Old Man of Stoer and his brother Buchaille ever since Patrick was tiny. It was lovely to take them to see <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-18.jpeg">the real thing</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>And then it was back to Lochinver. We had picked up a great little rod in Ullapool and <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-19.jpeg">Moss was keen to use it</a>! He had <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-20.jpeg">his very first fish</a> before too long, another little pollack. And then we caught what was <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-21.jpeg">our only mackerel</a> of the day.</p>
    
    
<p>Our week was drawing to a close. For our last night together, we had a great meal at Peet's Restaurant in Lochinver, followed by <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-22.jpeg">a great campfire</a> on the point, with <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-23.jpeg">toasted marshmallows</a> (and extra midges), with an incredible backdrop of <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-24.jpeg">a feiry sunset</a> over Loch Inver.</p>

    
<p>We still had to finish some repair work on <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-25.jpeg">Dezmond's bench at Achmelvich beach</a>. We left it in great condition and, after Gerry headed back south to Glasgow, we spent the day at <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-26.jpeg">the Assynt Highland Games</a>.Our week of prize winning wasn't over, as we won the family nature puzzle and the lovely folk at the Culag Nature Reserve sent us a nice mug down to Cheltenham as great memento of the trip.</p>
    
    
<p>Just time for one more stop at <a href="../images/Scotland-22/summer-22-27.jpeg">Ardvreck Castle on Loch Assynt</a> as we passed by and then a long trip back south to Cheltenham. It had been a really magical week in many ways and the girls had a great time too without us! So I can see this being a fixture of summer holidays in the years ahead.</p>
