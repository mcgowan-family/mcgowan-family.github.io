<P>As part of our <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/embarking.jpg">first trip overseas</A> with Patrick, we spent 4 days in Singapore. I was really looking forward to being in south-east Asia with Sarah and Singapore would be a great intro.</P>

<P>Patrick was great on the flight out, but we were still all <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/perak.jpg">pretty tired</A> by the time we got to the Perak Lodge in Little India. Little India is a great place to stay in Singapore, as you're right in the thick of everything. With lots to see on the doorstep, but easy MRT rides to all the other sights in Singapore.</P>

<P>You could be in the heart of downtown Bombay:</P>

<P>I didn't realise it at the time, but the Periachi deity is dedicated to babies and children, so that seemed appropriate.</P>

<P>Top spot to visit is the Botanic Gardens. We spent quite a few hours there, but you could easily spend a day:</P>

<P>We wandered round the old Colonial district at night. Stopped by <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/raffles.jpg">Raffles</A> which made Patrick <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/raffled.jpg">very happy</A>. He was a big hit with the waitresses. Then we wandered over to the Singapore river by <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/cavenagh%20bridge.jpg">Cavenagh Bridge</A>.</P>

<P>Everyone had recommended the night safari. Its definitely worth doing - the free flying bats are particularly good. No pictures though :o(</P>

<P>Despite being a small and very built up place, there are still a few wild corners. We headed to the Bukit Timah state park, where the <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/bukit%20timah2.jpg">Dipterocarp trees</A> still rule and wildlife like these<A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/bukit%20timah3.jpg"> Long-tailed Macaques</A> can still be found. There are very cool Giant Tree Shrews as well, but they were too quick for a picture. I also checked out the Sungei Buloh reserve and came across a family of <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/otters.jpg">Short-coated Otter</A> and a couple of <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/monitor2.jpg">huge Monitor Lizards</A>.Check out the tongue on <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/monitor1.jpg">this one</A>.</P>

<P>It was definitely <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/bukit%20timah1.jpg">a bit warm for Patrick</A>, but he coped pretty well and started sleeping through the night - probably from exhaustion! But in the morning, we were woken from sleep by the call to prayer at the <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/mid%20abdul%20gaffoor.jpg">Mid Abdul Gafoor mosque</A>.</P>

<P>Another area to check out is Arab Street. Famous for its <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/arab%20street.jpg">silk stalls</A>, it's now gone a bit upmarket and touristy, but <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/sultan%20mosque1.jpg">the Sultan Mosque</A> gives a dignified air and is <A HREF="../images/Singapore%2008/sultan%20mosque2.jpg">a cooler spot</A> to get out of the heat in the middle of the day.</P>

<P>After four days, we felt we'd seen quite a bit and it was time to head for <A HREF="new-zealand-2008.html">New Zealand</A>!</P>
