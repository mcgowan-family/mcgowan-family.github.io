<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Washington, DC, 2007</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Visited Washington on work trip and took some of the folk around DC on the Sunday. It was quiet as usual, and we parked up by <A HREF="../images/USA/DC1-nov-08.jpg">the Capitol</A>.</P>

<P>We stopped in by the White House, but there were no white squirrels.</P>

<P>Headed across to Arlington and paid our respects to <A HREF="../images/USA/DC2-nov-08.jpg">the great man</A>. It was a beautiful day and we saw the changing of the honor guard.</P>

<P>Came back over and had lunch in <A HREF="../images/USA/DC3-nov-08.jpg">the JFK Centre</A> for the Performing Arts in Watergate. Great views from the roof top terrace.</P>

<P>Popped in to see <A HREF="../images/USA/DC4-nov-08.jpg">Lincoln</A>, wandered round <A HREF="../images/USA/DC5-nov-08.jpg">the Vietnam memorial</A>, spent some time with <A HREF="../images/USA/DC6-nov-08.jpg">Jefferson</A> and finished off with a  bit of FDR. Can't believe <A HREF="../images/USA/DC7-nov-08.jpg">some of the spongers</A> you see claiming benefit.</P>
