<P>We've moved out of Elko Drive and are currently at leisure in the Hampton Suites by Arundel Mills. The surplus of our life is in 115 boxes heading across the Atlantic. All the key stuff is in two bags that we will shortly drag around the world.</P>

<P>Both of us finish at the Agency this week - 31 Jan. It's been a great 4 years. We will roll into London on 31 Mar. We have no forwarding address and no long-term home sorted for when we get there!</P>

<P>In the interim, you can reach us at paulmcgowan@mac.com</P>
