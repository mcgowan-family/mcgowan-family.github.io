<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Historic Portsmouth & Gosport, August 2024</H1>
</DIV>

<p>For quite some time we had been planning to spend a few days seeing the historic dockyards in Portsmouth. With Moss now being 9, this felt like a good year to finally get there.</p>

<p>Sarah found a great little town house sat at the edge of Hasler Creek and overlooking Hasler Marina. It was a vreat base and ideally placed to walk to the submarie section of the historic docks. One of the most striking features in the whole museum is the <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-01.jpeg">HMS Alliance submarine</a>.</p>

<p>We spent a whole day going around the dockyards over in Portsmouth. You catch the ferry from the submarine section of the museum, which was really handy as we could walk there. One of the things we all wanted to see was HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship. This was <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-02.jpeg">Nelson's great cabin</a>. There was a lot to see and you got a real sense of what it was like to <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-03.jpeg">live below decks</a>. After he was shot at Trafalgar, Nelson was carried below decks. This lamp marks <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-04.jpeg">the spot where he died</a>.</p>


<p>It was incredible to see HMS Victory and HMS Queen Elizabeth <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-05.jpeg">side by side in a working dockyard</a>.</p>


<p>I love that Bryher still <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-06.jpeg">joins Moss for crabbing</a>. I wonder for how much longer :)</p>


<p>A few days after we got there, <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-07.jpeg">the HMS Prince of Wales</a> arrived in port to join its sister ship.</p>
    
    
<p>We spent a day over on the Isle of Wight. Toward sthe end of the day we ended up in the lovely little town of Yarmouth. This is us <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-08.jpeg">on the pier</a>. We went over by car ferry, but there is also <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-09.jpeg">the last comercial hovercraft service</a> going over every 20 minutes.</p>
    
     
<p>As well as some lovely days on the beach, mainly at Stokes Bay, much of the time was spent at the various museums around the historic docks. The Mary Rose museum was incredible. I need much more time in there. By the end of the week, only Patrick and me were still up for more museum miles. This is Patrick <a href="../images/Gosport-24/gosport-24-10.jpeg">in the Munitions Museum</a>, his happy place :)</p>
