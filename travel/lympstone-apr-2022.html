<p>Sarah found us another great little accommodation for the Easter break. This time we were down on the south Devon coast, on the east shore of the estuary of the River Exe, in a tiny little village called Lympstone. Although a small village, it had great transport links, being an easy hop from the M5 by car, having a train link north to Exeter and south to Exmouth and a bike trail that runs from Exmouth up to Exeter and down the other side to Dawlish.</p>

<p>It was another wonderful place to stay. The little cottage was right on the water with <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/sarah-scans.jpeg">amazing views from every window</a>. The estuary ebbed up and down twice each day. Sometimes with exposed snadbanks and little groups of waders outsid ethe window and at other times the water came right up under teh windows, allowing the kids to fish for crabs out thet living room windows.</p>
    
<p>Lympstone has retained <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/lympstone-well.jpeg">a lot of it's early charm</a>. It's best appreciated on foot, with <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/pump-lane.jpeg">little lanes</a> that lead <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/quay-lane.jpeg">down to the sea</a> from the main street that runs through it. There is still a very small <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/fishermans-house.jpeg">active fishery</a> and fishing artefacts are <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/lympstone-buoys.jpeg">scattered around the lanes</a> that lead to the harbour.</p>

<p>So of course, we brought the rods and the nets with us! <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/bryher-casts.jpeg">Bryher had a go</a> at casting from the harbour and the beach, and <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/patrick-casts.jpeg">Patrick did as well</a>.Mossy focussed more on <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/moss-crabs.jpeg">catching as many crabs as possible</a>!</p>

<p>Me and Moss did a cracking bike trip up to Topsham that took us past the Marine's training camp just north of the village. We went out on a great sea fishing trip when everyone caught fish - Sarah got a Conger Eel, I had a Skate, Patrick got a Starry Smooth Hound and Bryher and Moss each had loads of Dogfish.</p>

 
<p>So after a wonderful week, it was time to head off, but not before we had <a href="../images/Lympstone 22/rockfish-exmouth.jpeg">a last night meal</a> at The Rockfish restaurant in Exmouth. </p>
