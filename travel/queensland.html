<P>I arrived in Cairns on 17 March</P>

<P>Half way through the week hostillities began as the Iraq War commenced. This would turn out to be much longer, bloodier and, in the end, less justified, than anyone realised at this point. </P>
    
<p>The person in the street here is unconvinced of the course of action, but resigned to it now that it's started and keen to get out of it with as few casualties on all sides. Our thoughts are with the rest of you back in the US and UK.</p>

<P>I picked up a campervan from Britz and headed north up the coast. First stop was the little town of Port Douglas where we did a trip out to the Barrier Reef. Now I know it's <A HREF="../images/Queensland/dive.jpg">a funny picture</A>, but I really have wanted to dive on the Great Barrier Reef for a very long time.</P>

<P>The reef dive was one of the highlights of the trip. It's a long time since being certified as a PADI diver and I hadn't planned to dive, but it just worked out nicely.</P>

</P>Most folk head up to Cape Trib from Cairns, but I fancied seeing something different, so we took the advice of the locals and headed inland to <A HREF="../images/Queensland/atherton_tablelands.jpg">the Atherton Tablelands</A>.</P>

<P>Once again we were lucky with the weather. The locals claimed that most of the place was normally cut off during the wet, but we were treated to <A HREF="../images/Queensland/atherton_pastoral.jpg">blue sky days</A> with just enough mist in the morning to keep the rainforest happy.</P>

<P>One of the things I've enjoyed most about Australia, is the small town life that still goes on. Places with enough folk that they need all the services, but not enough folk that the services become an out-of-town strip mall. Malanda is just such a place</P>

<P>Malanda is the dairy capital of North Queensland, so I'll assume you've all heard of it.</P>

<LI>you might choose to stay at <A HREF="../images/Queensland/malanda_hotel.jpg">the Malanda Hotel</A></LI>
<LI>you'll certainly want to send your cards from the <A HREF="../images/Queensland/malanda_post_office.jpg">Malanda Post Office</A></LI>
<LI>maybe ride down to <A HREF="../images/Queensland/malanda_majestic.jpg">the Majestic</A> to watch the excellent <I>Bowling for Columbine</I></LI>
<LI>after all that effort, sink a pint of VB at <A HREF="../images/Queensland/malanda_bar.jpg">the Malanda Bar</A></LI>

<P>I love the fact that you can put a fiver on <I>Forlorn Hope</I> in the 2:30 at Melbourne and buy a nice cold pint in the same room. Very civilised.</P>

<P>For anyone following on, the <A HREF="../images/Queensland/van.jpg">campsite at Eacham Lake</A> is a great place to stay. Tree Kangaroos, rainforest and a fantastic freshwater lake to swim in.</P>

<P>Some of the highlights of the Atherton Tablelands are the waterfalls. There's a great swimming hole at <A HREF="../images/Queensland/milla_milla_falls.jpg">Millaa Millaa falls</A>, and <A HREF="../images/Queensland/ellinjaa_falls.jpg">Elinjaa Falls</A> is perfect.</P>

</P>Never have so many, looked in such vain, for so few. There is a Duck-billed Platypus in <A HREF="../images/Queensland/mungalli_creek.jpg">this creek</A>. If you look very, very carefully you may be able to see it.</P>

<P>We left the Tablelands after a few days and descended to the coast at South Mission Beach. From there, you can catch a water taxi and spend the day out on Dunk Island.</P>

<P>I'd recommend <A HREF="../images/Queensland/dunk_island.jpg">Dunk Island</A>. It's very relaxed, very tropical and has everything you need to chill for a day or a week. Take a walk up Mount Kootaloo for the view of <A HREF="../images/Queensland/family_isles.jpg">the Family Islands</A>, or just <A HREF="../images/Queensland/muggy_muggy.jpg">laze on the beach</A> and read a book.</P>

<P>The snorkelling wasn't brilliant on Dunk. It has a good fringing reef, but the viz was way down; that made the encounter with the shark all the more entertaining. Fortunately it was a White-tipped Reef Shark which have an excellent track record of not monstering swimmers; but I still felt a chill when it appeared four feet away out of the blue and proceeded to put the frighteners on the local fish population.</P>


<P>We finished off our stay in Queensland on the lovely <A HREF="../images/Queensland/ellis_beach.jpg">Ellis Beach</A>.</P>
