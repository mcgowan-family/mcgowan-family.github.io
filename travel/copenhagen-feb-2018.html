<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Copenhagen, February 2018</H1>
</DIV>

<P>For Sarah's birthday this year, we headed of to Copenhagen - <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-1.jpg">in February</a>!!. It is listed as a great detsination for kids and Sarah's good friend Joey lives there, so it would be nice to catch up with her as well.</P>

<p>As you might imagine, it was Baltic! Oh yeah, and Patrick had left his jacket in the departure lounge at Heathrow. So we did a fair bit indoors. Copenhagen now hosts <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-2.jpg">Europes largest aquarium</a>, The Blue Planet. It is <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-3.jpg">absolutley fantastic</a> and well worth a day.</p>

<p>We had to do the compulsory boat tour of <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-4.jpg">the canals and harbours</a> that run through Copenhagen. It's a lovely trip - although as many will have noted, the Little Mermaid is something of an anticlimax.</p>

<p>One of the highlights was <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-11.jpg">Tivoli Gardens</a>. We were so lucky in that Tivoli was open for the very first time this year during the February half term! It had been decked out in <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-5.jpg">wintry garb</a>. We got all-day tickets that meant the kids could just jump <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-6.jpg">on and off the rides</a>. The whole place was <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-7.jpg">magical</a>.Moss was certainly <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-8.jpg">carried away by it all</a>. Some rides were lovely period ones, whereas others were <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-9.jpg">scary modern beasts</a>. Bryher went strangely quiet at this point, <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-10.jpg">63 metres up</a>!</p>

<p>Another good indoor venue is the Experimentarium. This is a bit like @Bristol, but bigger and newer. Patrick & Bryher had <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-12.jpg">quite a crowd</a> on this experiment that involved calming your brain signals to win the day. There were plenty of <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-13.jpg">hands-on experiments</a> too!</p>


<p>Copenhagen itself is a centre of broad boulevards and <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-14.jpg">historic palaces</a> and churches. There are plenty of museums, if that's your thing, and the National Museum of Denmark has lots of stuff on <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-15.jpg">those famous Vikings</a>!</p>


<p>We finished as we had started, having <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-16.jpg">magical fun inTivoli</a>, and <a href="../images/Copenhagen-18/copenhagen-0218-17.jpg">looking forward</a> to the next time we would be back..</p>
