<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>A short break on Lundy, August 2025</H1>
</DIV>

<p>We had stayed on Lundy a couple of times before, but the last time was in 2015, when Sarah was heavily pregnant with Moss. The trouble was, it had become increasingly popular and very difficult to find accommodation, unless you booked a couple of years in advance! Happily, we managed to find a few days free and booked for August.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-01.jpeg">The Oldenburg crossing</a> was as eventful as ever. There was a storm forecast - isn't there always - and all day crossings were cancelled. But they agreed to make an effort to get anyone with accomodation booked to the island.The crossing was actually a lot of fun, with rolling seas and big waves washing across the boat.And after a couple of hours, we made it into the shelter of the eastern approaches to Lundy.</p>


<p>Once ashore, we familiarised ourselves with the new sheds at the landing area and then made our way up the steep access road to the village. Our accommodation in The Quarters wouldn't be available till 3, so we set off up the east side of the island. The weather was suny with the odd shower. This is us <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-02.jpeg">all taking shelter</a> below the large rock in VC Quarry from one of those showers :) The quarry is so-named in memory of John Penington Harman, who was awarded a posthumous VC in memory of his actions at Kohima in 1944. </p>


<p>Since our last visit, Lundy had been re-established as one of the UK's bird observatories. So while we were there, I took the opportunity to get up early and see what was about, as the mirgation season was just getting going. Blue-headed Wagtail was my best bird find. Although it was only August, some of the mother Grey Seals had already given birth to their pups. <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-04.jpeg">This very young pup</a> is sheltering in one of the little coves on the east side of the island.</p>


<p>It was time to get back and check out the new accommodation. The Quarters is a lovely spot, very warm and cosy and set right in eth heart of the village, so very conventient. As normal, there is no TV or wifi, so the kids < a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-03.jpeg">crack out the games</a> and make their own fun :)</p> 
    
    
<p>The next day looked best weather wise, so we picked up a new copy of the famous Letterbox Challenge and headed up the east side of the island. Sarah was challenged by some of the steeper slopes on that east side, that triggered her sense of vertigo. But working as a family, we made it back on to the plateau, and <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-06.jpeg">a sunny spot for lunch</a>. Bryher and Moss and me, descended down to Brazen Ward an the kids found <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-05.jpeg">a tricky letterbox</a>. There were a lot of adult seals hauled out on Brazen Ward.</p>

<p>We continued north all the way to <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-07.jpeg">the North Light</a>. We came across <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-08.jpeg">the amazing feeral goats</a> up there with there fabulous long horns. It had been a long hike toget there and it was obviously time for <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-10.jpeg">a well-earned rest</a>.</p>
    
<p>It was time to head back south. The weather had been wonderful and <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-09.jpeg">Moss pointed out</a> onto a calm western sea under a blue sky.There were a lot more letterboxes to find, including tricky ones at Earthquake and this one at <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-11.jpeg">the Hidden Heinkel</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>We were almost back at the village, but there was still time to climb up <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-12.jpeg">the Old Light</a>. It had been a long day in the sun, as can be seen in teh faces of Moss and Bryher <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-13.jpeg">as they relax</a> at the top of the Old Light. </p>
    
<p>Our plan had been to spend the next day finishing off the letter boxes in the south end of the island. But the weather had other plans. And while <a href="../images/Lundy-25/lundy-0825-14.jpeg">the day dawned beautifully</a>, an even bigger storm was forecast for that afternoon, so the sailing was brought forward, meaning our last day was foreshortened.</p>
    
<p>But despite the short duration of our stay, it had really rekindled our love for the island and of course it was Moss's first chance to see the place. We joined the <a href="https://www.lundy.org.uk">Lundy Field Society</a> on our return home and I ended up booking to come back on the Lundy Discoveryu Week that would take place in May 2026. I'm sure it won't be the last time we all get to visit :)</p>
