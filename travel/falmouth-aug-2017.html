<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Falmouth, August 2017</H1>
</DIV>

<P>We found a nice little flat down in Falmouth for our Summer break and for <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/moss-birthday.jpg">Moss's birthday</a>. Itw as at the next beach along from Falmouth itself at a place called Swanpool.</P>

<p>As you might expect, we spent most of the week <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/bryher-moss.jpg">on the  beaches</a> nearby. Round the coast from Swanpool is the lovely little beach at Maenporth, which had a really <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/cave.jpg">cool little cave</a> system that cut back uner the road into the tidal pool behind. Full of crabs!!</p>

<p>Falmouth is a great spot. The National Maritime Museum is <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/moss-pirate.jpg">loads of fun</a>. Next door was The Shack, where we all enjoyed <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/patricks-crab.jpg">an amazing crab dinner</a>. </p>

<p>On the way home from Falmouth, we crossed the Fal on the Fal on <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/captain-pirate.jpg">King Harry's Ferry</a> and made our way to the lovely little village and <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/st-mawes.jpg">castle at St.Mawes</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone agreed it had been <a href="../images/Falmouth-17/three-up.jpg">a top week</a>!.</p>
