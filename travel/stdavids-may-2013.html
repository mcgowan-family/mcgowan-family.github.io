<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>St Davids Summer 2013</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Our trip to West Wales the year before had been such a hit, that we all decided to do it again :) <a href="../images/StDavids13/severn-crossing.jpg">The journey out</a> was largely uneventful, up until the point Dave and Jules' Land Rover fell apart! But all was well, as the AA came to our rescue and we all got to the campsite before the day was out.</P>

<p>We had <a href="../images/StDavids13/blond-bunch.jpg">a great little bunch of kids</a>, but we had to keep them busy with tiring walks round <a href="../images/StDavids13/gorse.jpg">the coastal path</a>. And after all that walking, it was definitely time to find <a href="../images/StDavids13/below-stairs.jpg">a cosy spot</a> and get some food on board.

<p>It was pretty much the same crew as last year. <a href="../images/StDavids13/cartwright.jpg">The Cartwright's</a> were there, I'm assuming Beth doesn't do Steve's wardrobe selection. Will and Jo were there (in the new van, but no pictures!!). The Pieirinis were there - you can just see Ashwin winning all the money at <a href="../images/StDavids13/van-cards.jpg">van poker</a>. Ian, Helen and Taryn were there. Imogen and the kids were there. And <a href="../images/StDavids13/breakfast.jpg">Dave and Jules</a> were there.</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time down by the sea. And a lot of time <a href="../images/StDavids13/attitude.jpg">getting ready</a> to go down to the sea. But once we got there it was <a href="../images/StDavids13/steve-ash.jpg">lots of fun</a>. At least <a href="../images/StDavids13/bryher-beach.jpg">Bryher certainly thought so</a>.</p>

<p>Every year there seems to be <a href="../images/StDavids13/landy-van.jpg">an extra van</a>. And they come in <a href="../images/StDavids13/heinz.jpg">many varieties</a>. And while <a href="../images/StDavids13/kite.jpg">I'm flying a kite</a>, I'd like to think we'll do this, or something just as much fun as this, next year :)</p>
