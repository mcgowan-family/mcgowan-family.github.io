<H1>Round the World in 70 Days</H1>

<P>Or is it 71? Whatever.</P>

<P>When I returned from the US to live in the UK again in 2003,  I did it as a 'round the world trip. The RTW started from Cheltenham on 20 January. We flew out of Heathrow back to Dulles. Starting from London is a prerequisite of the RTW tix that agents sell - it's a hassle for the traveller.</P>

<P>I had a couple of weeks work to finish off in DC, then flew out from BWI on 2 February, transitted via LAX and arrived in the Cook Islands on 3 February.</P>

<P>A week in the Cooks is to be recommended. Two weeks would be better still. For more details, check out the <A HREF="cooks.html">Cooks page</A>.</P>

<P>From the Cooks, I headed to <A HREF="north_island.html">North Island</A>, New Zealand. A week and a half was far too little time, but we did manage to catch up with Carl, which was just right.</P>


<P>Across the Cook Strait, the <A HREF="south_island.html">South Island</A> is quite a different place. Alpine in the west and pastoral in the east, with all sorts of adventure waiting in the south.</P>

<P>Melbourne was the port of arrival in Australia and one of the highlights of <A HREF="vic_and_south.html">Victoria and South Australia</A>. The Great Ocean Road and the wine regions north of there took up the rest of the time.</P>

<P>A lot of folk claim that <A HREF="top_end.html">the Top End</A> is the real Australia. Kakadu and friendly folk were the highlights.</P>

<P><A HREF="queensland.html">Queensland</A> was fabulous. The Atherton Tablelands were cool and green and diving on the Barrier Reef was an unexpected highlight.</P>

<P><A HREF="sydney.html">Sydney</A> lived up to expectations with all the sights of the harbour. A useful tip is to arrange accommodation in the airport arrivals area - cheaper than the net.</P>

<P>I had been warned that <A HREF="singapore.html">Singapore</A> would be sterile and overly policed. Maybe because of all the warnings, I found it a pleasant surprise. Certainly less culture-shock than the rest of South-East Asia, but worth a visit.</P>

<P>And finally, back to the UK.</P>
