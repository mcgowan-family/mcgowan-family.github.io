</DIV>

<P>This was a fairly major trip with skiing, biking, hiking and climbing, across 2 states. The weather was stunning throughout and it was great to be back in the Rockies.</P>

<P>Mike met us at Denver International and after sorting hire cars out, we headed down to their place in Centennial, Denver, where Mike is known as the real life model for Bob from The Incredibles (<A HREF="../images/Skiing/mike&nikki.jpg">check it out</A>, they're not wrong!). </P>

<P>Next day we headed west on the 70 into Summit County. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/brekky.jpg">We skied together</A> - by which I mean we chased Mike down the mountain - for two days, across Keystone and Breckenridge.</P>

<P>Mike & Nikki headed back to Denver and we headed for the great little town of Crested Butte. CB is an old mining town and still retains a lot of character. It sits amid a great range of hills and we stayed at the excellent <A HREF="../images/Skiing/elk-mountain-lodge.jpg">Elk Mountain Lodge</A>.</P>

<P>Crested Butte had benefited from <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-2.jpg">a lot of snow</A> prior to our arrival and some of the homes were still <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-1.jpg">surrounded by the white stuff</A>. It would be a while before anyone would be <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-3.jpg">lighting the BBQ</A>. The Elk Mountain Lodge is owned and managed by Mike and Amy - both of whom skied backcountry - the place was very relaxed and had a big soft Malamute to keep you company. The Main Street was a good collection of basic high street stuff (post office, coffee shops) and a couple of outdoor stores. Loads of places to eat and drink and a great setting with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-4.jpg">Mount Emmons to the west</A> and Crested Butte Mountain to the North.</P>

<P>CB is surrounded by great mountains and we mixed up <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mt-emmons-west.jpg">backcountry</A>, nordic and <A HREF="../images/Skiing/third-bowl-chute.jpg">alpine</A> skiing over the next 4 days.</P>

<P>After CB we drove north into Utah, stopping at the <A HREF="../images/USA/black-gorge.jpg">Black Gorge of the Gunnison</A> and at Moab. The Moab half marathon was on the weekend we arrived and accommodation trended to zero. We ended up splitting up to get rooms, but we were lucky to get in anywhere. It was a bit of a rush, but we made it back up to the park and out to <A HREF="../images/USA/delicate1.jpg">Delicate Arch</A> for sunset. <A HREF="../images/USA/delicate-andrew-hilary.jpg">Andrew and Hilary</A> seemed pleased and I ran round to the point <A HREF="../images/USA/delicate-me.jpg">just south of the arch</A> just as the sun went down. <A HREF="../images/USA/delicate2.jpg">The view from there</A> was stunning as the rock went deeper shades of ochre in the setting sun. Top breakfast in Moab is at the Red Rock Bakery on Main. The owner is a Celtic supporter from Dundee called Howard. Still can't believe he gave up the delights of <A HREF="http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/webcam/">Dundee</A> for the uncertain future of Moab ;o) After breakfast, Andrew and Hilary headed back up to the park and I headed off for the delights of <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_05.html">the Porcupine Rim</A>.</P>

<P>We picked up 'lunch to go' back at the Red Rock (best butties too!) and headed north over the flat lands for Salt Lake.</P>

<P>We skied the Wasatch range for 4 days; skiing at Park City, Canyonlands and Alta. I also popped over to the Uintas for some <A HREF="../images/Skiing/canyonlands-backcountry.jpg">backcountry</A> and checked out <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mount-timpanogos.jpg">Sundance</A> on the way back. Black Diamond's headquarters are in Salt lake and there's a store!! Much time was spent oggling the various bits of gear and I left with a small arsenal in ice screws, crampons, poles etc.</P>

<P>The accommodation at Park City (Blue Church Lodge) wasn't as good as Crested Butte. It was OK, but definitely missed the personal touch. No Malamute either.</P>

<P>After 5 days, we set off on our return to Denver. It's a straight shot east on the I-80 and we made great time as far as Rawlins. We made a bit too much time and I got pulled for 60 in a 30 as we drove into town. The town cop reckoned he had two options, "I can send you to jail or send you out of town".  I replied that I knew which my mother would thank him more for. He saw the funny side and sent us on our way. Just as well he wasn't a Trooper. How funny would that have been though!! Turns out the <A HREF="https://corrections.wyo.gov/institutional-information/wyoming-state-penitentiary">State Penitentiary</A> really is in Rawlins, so it looks like he wasn't kidding. We can recommend the 'Straight Shooter' cafe on Main - great corned beef.</P>

<P>There was a major storm coming in as we left town. Trucks were blown over on the interstate and they closed it. We headed south on a road, which became a track and then a snow drift. Back to town and headed north to Casper, I-25 and back to Denver for Mike's birthday!!</P>

<P>Major shopping on last day for all those things that folk asked us for, then back to Heathrow - boooh :o0</P>
