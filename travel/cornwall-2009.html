<P>We hadn't been away for a while and it seemed we better get some in while Sarah was still able. Sarah found us a great little cottage on an old farm down near Looe and we all set off.</P>

<P>The weather was generally brilliant all week, but there was one day of heavy rain forecast so we planned a trip to the Eden Project. Lots of plants, cool biomes, <A HREF="../images/Family/green-man-eden.jpg">amazing sculptures</A> and lots more. Patrick's mouth drops open as he realises that not only is Dad a sporting god, <A HREF="../images/Family/juggling-eden.jpg">he can do tricks</A>!!!  Can't put my finger on <A HREF="../images/Family/eve-eden.jpg">who this reminds me of</A> ....</P>

<P>Next day we settled into what would be the pattern for the week. Nice breakfast, then off to a nearby beach - in this case, <A HREF="../images/Family/talland-09.jpg">Talland Bay</A> - go for a drive before Patrick gets too tired, then hopefully he goes to sleep and we have a nice lunch, then go find somewhere else nice in the afternoon - in this case <A HREF="../images/UK/fowey-09.jpg">Fowey</A> - before <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-fowey-09.jpg">heading on</A> for dinner. Patrick settled into <A HREF="../images/Family/dude-talland-09.jpg">beach life</A> pretty well! And occasionally turned into a <A HREF="../images/Family/gertie-talland-09.jpg">giggling gertie</A>.</P>

<P>One day at Port Wrinkle beach, just as Paul and Patrick were <A HREF="../images/Family/portwrinkle1-09.jpg">playing in the sand</A>,<A HREF="../images/Family/portwrinkle2-09.jpg"> a zombie</A> appeared from nowhere!!! It was night of the living dead all over!! But Patrick calmy finished him off with the trusty <A HREF="../images/Family/portwrinkle3-09.jpg">eye gouge</A>.</P>

<P>Next day took us over to the North coast and Padstow. We were pretty impressed by the Rick Stein stuff. Lots of hype of course, but you can't argue with pasties like that. The town is pretty, but very busy, so we headed just round the coast to Harlyn Bay, which is gorgeous and <A HREF="../images/Family/harlyn1-09.jpg">just right for Patrick</A>. Nice sand and lots of little pools. <A HREF="../images/Family/harlyn2-09.jpg">His Mum liked it too</A>, although I think she may have over indulged on the pasties ;o) Patrick loved it so much, he got a wee bit cold, but we <A HREF="../images/Family/harlyn3-09.jpg">wrapped him up</A> in warm towels and he was fine in no time. I lost my wallet from my ragged Howie shorts on the way to the car, but a nice lady called Carol Longman sent it back home to me. Thanks Carol!!!</P>

<P>Way too soon it was our last full day, so we decided to do exactly the same thing as all the others and go and find a lovely beach. But what a beach!! You need to do a short walk to get to it and that seemed enough to put folk off, because unbelievably we were the only ones on there. Sarah was <A HREF="../images/Family/porthalland2.jpg">in heaven</A>!  The weather was a wee bit changeable that day. Guess which one <A HREF="../images/Family/porthalland1.jpg">grew up in Glasgow</A> ;o)</P>

<P>On the way back home, we decided to get a fishing rod and <A HREF="../images/Family/talland-fishing-09.jpg">catch supper</A>. Fortunately we had a plan B. Great fun though.</P>

<P>On our very last day, we went to the monkey sanctuary near Looe, which we can recommend. Nice people, doing a good job and with a great veggie restaurant as well.  We'll certainly be back to Cornwall. Felt just right for family holidays and reminded us both of  similar ones, many years ago .....</P>
