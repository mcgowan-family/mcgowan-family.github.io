<P>In August 2010, we set off on our first big holiday in the van. We had been away for the odd night here and there, but this was going to be 2 weeks. Once again, we set off looking for the now mythical Selsey shark's teeth. Still now joy, but more <a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2001.jpg">lovely shots of Patrick</a> and nice sunsets on <a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2002.jpg">the beach at Bracklesham</a>.</P>

<p>We popped over from Portsmoth to Caen, which was very exciting for everyone. Taking the van on a boat!! We decided not to go too far, so spent the first few nights in Normandy in the pretty little down of Falaise. It was the birthplace and power base of William the Conqueror. Patrick started to getting into the mood for <a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2003.jpg">a bit of conquering</a>. The campsite was <a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2004.jpg">directly below the castle</a>, which was very dramatic.</p>

<p>We headed south from Falaise to the south Brittany coast around Batz-sur-Mer. It wsa a great location, but the camp site left a lot to be desired. One lesson is probably not to go camping in France in August. Half of Paris seemed to be staying on the same camp site.</p>

<p>We escaped from that site and headed west and north into the wilder parts of Brittany. We were lucky enough to stumble upon a real gem of a camp site at Landeda, just west of La Rochelle. We were right on the beach and at low tide, we could walk out to a string of little granite islands. Bryher thought it was just great, and we made her<a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2005.jpg"> a nappy hat </a>to celebrate.</p>

<p>It was <a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2006.jpg">an idyllic little spot </a>and I hope we go back one day. Patrick had a great time every day, and even got to try <a href="../images/Family/brittany-0811%2007.jpg">horse riding for the first time</a>. It was a big hit and he was very sorry to say goodbye to his pony, Belle.</p>


<p>We caught the ferry back to Plymouth from Roscoffe and made our way back home through the West Country. A sketchy start, but a lovely finish and a great first outing for the van :)</p>
