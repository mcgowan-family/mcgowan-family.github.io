<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>York at Christmas, December 2024</H1>
</DIV>

<p>We headed up to York in the days just before Christmas.We took the train, which is normally a very restful way to get anywhere. On this occasion it was completely rammed, but still more restful than driving :)</p>

<p>As well as just wandering round the old city, we had some specific things on our list and our first stop was <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-01.jpeg">the National Railway Museum</a>. We <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-02.jpeg">all enjoyed it</a> and Moss was especiialy happy to see <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-03.jpeg">the only Bullet Train</a> outside of Japan:)</p>

<p>We were staying in a really nice Airbnb just outside the city walls close to the Monk Bar gateway. The first evening we just wandered round the old city and came across <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-04.jpeg">this procession</a> heading to the Minster. The old part of the city is wonderfully historic. One of the best preserved sections is The Shambles, <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-05.jpeg">looking very spooky</a> this evening.</p>


<p>The next morning, we got up and headed round the city walls. This is a lovely way to see the town, with lots of unexpected views into hidden corners. Half way around we came to <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-07.jpeg">Clifford Tower</a>. This ancient fort has very recently been restored, such that it is now possible to get up onto the battlements at the top, which affords <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-06.jpeg">another great view of the city</a>.</p>


<p>Another thing to see in York is the Jorvik Centre. I had wanted to see this for many years, in fact since it was originally opened. I was worried that it might be a little tired after so many years, but they have kept it nicely up to date. The <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-08.jpeg">ride through the recreated Viking village</a> is great. Everyone else struggled with the smell, but not having that sense, I was protected :) The collection of artefacts is also really interesting, along with some recreation of viking crafts, like <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-09.jpeg">this coin smith</a>.</p>


<p>We had been lucky enough to secure some tickets to attend Nine Lessons & Carols at <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-10.jpeg">the Minster</a>.We took the opportunity to <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-11.jpeg">wander round the Minster</a> after the service finished. The service was presided over by Stephen Cottrell the currrent Archbishop of York. Cottrell is curently embroiled in another church child abuse scandal and he referenceed this in his service. It was fascinating to go over this a week later with Gary the vicar next door, who is scathing in his views of how the church is handling this and other child sex cases, such as John Smyth.</p>
    
    
<p>Back out in the narrow streets of York, there were <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-12.jpeg">wonderful little gems</a> everywhere you looked. This is the shortest street <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-13.jpeg">with the longest name</a>. No one really knows why :) Theer was a lovely old carousel and <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-14.jpeg">Moss and his Mum</a> took a spin.</p>
    
     
<p>Our last day was more wanderings around the walls and old town. One of the highlights for the kids was a lovely little cafe <a href="../images/York-24/york-24-15.jpeg">with amazing drinks</a>! We all really enjoyed York. Easier to get a sense of the whole place than London and a lovely run in to Christmas </p>
