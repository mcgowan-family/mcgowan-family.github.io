</DIV>

<P>Patrick had been doing Ancient Greece as his project in school this year. We decided to bring it to life for him by taking him to where it all started.</P>

<p>It almost didn't start at all, as I set off to late form Cheltenham for the early morning trip to Stansted. We raced down the M4 at breakneck speed and threw ourselves on the mercy of the check-in staff. I'll never know how, but we made it by the skin of our teeth and arrived in a sweaty mee on board. <a href="../images/Greece%2016/moss-flight-0816.jpg">Moss looked pretty relaxed</a> about it all. And just a few hours later, we were sitting having a lovely meal <a href="../images/Greece%2016/made-it-0816.jpg">in the Plaka District</a>.</p>

<p>We spent two days <a href="../images/Greece%2016/metropole-0816.jpg">exploring the Plaka</a> and all the ancient remains in the nearby Acropolis. A very hot day started just above <a href="../images/Greece%2016/theatre-0816.jpg">the ancient theatre</a>. This is <a href="../images/Greece%2016/erechtheion-0816.jpg">the Erectheion</a> - we're starting to look a little warm. You can just see <a href="../images/Greece%2016/caryatids-0816.jpg">the Caryatids</a> in the background - these became a running commentary of our time in Athens, due to Lord Elgin running off with one of them and a boat full of other treasures. <a href="../images/Greece%2016/parthenon-0816.jpg">The Parthenon</a> is undergoing a lon-running restoration, but it is as awe-inspiring as ever.</p>

<p>We  came down from the heat of the Acropolis and stopped just long enough to get a shot of <a href="../images/Greece%2016/patrick-acropolis-0816.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Greece%2016/bryher-acropolis-0816.jpg">Bryher</a> looking back up.</p>

<p>Often listed in the top 10, the new Museum of the Acropolis is a must see. The building sits o many of the ancient remains and enables you to see them beneath your feet, but also, it creates a setting to display many of the finer elements of the original in a wya that you wouldn't be able to appreciate them otherwise. This is <a href="../images/Greece%2016/parthenon-frieze-0816.jpg">a section of the frieze</a> from the Parthenon. The <a href="../images/Greece%2016/parthenon-frieze-2-0816.jpg">pediment from the Parthenon</a> - missing some famous Elgin pieces! And now <a href="../images/Greece%2016/real-caryatids-0816.jpg">the real Caryatids</a> - note 5, not 6 - that man Elgin again.</p>

<p>Athens has so much to offer, but al that walking takes a toll. A very weary family in <a href="../images/Greece%2016/forum-0816.jpg">the classical Forum.</a> the heat of the day was past as we wandered round <a href="../images/Greece%2016/temple-of-hephaestus-0816.jpg">the Temple of Hephaestos</a>. Check out <a href="../images/Greece%2016/tortoise-0816.jpg">this huge tortoise</a> that Patrick found! As we wandered back to the hotel, we stopped in at the amazing <a href="../images/Greece%2016/wind-tower-0816.jpg">Tower of the Winds.</a> Just <a href="../images/Greece%2016/clerical-robes-0816.jpg">fooling about</a>.</p>

<p>We spent a couple of nights in Athens, but then it was off to the Peloponnese. <a href="../images/Greece%2016/moss-wistful-0816.jpg">Moss doesn't know</a> where the Peloponnese is. We had decided to spend a night at Olympia. Turned put to be <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-pool-0816.jpg">a great hotel</a>. Bryher <a href="../images/Greece%2016/bryher-pool-0816.jpg">loved the pool</a>!. Our visit coincided with the opening of the Rio Olympics, but the ancient site was <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-1-0816.jpg">tranquil and almost deserted</a> - a strange contrast. It was the cool of the evening and we had <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-2-0816.jpg">the place to ourselves</a>. It turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. .The <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-3-0816.jpg">athletes were getting ready</a> to compete, and <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-4-0816.jpg">then they were off</a>, and <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-5-0816.jpg">Bryher appears to win</a> - although there may have been a bit of cheating! But it's not the winning, <a href="../images/Greece%2016/olympia-6-0816.jpg">it's the taking part</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick has really enjoyed studying Ancient Greece at school. And that had been the spur for this trip. Olympia was where that really came to life around the story of <a href="../images/Greece%2016/miltaides-0816.jpg">Miltaides</a>. He had been the ancient Athenian general who commanded the Greeks at Marathon. When Patrick realised he was looking at his actual helmet, with his name, inscribed by him, on the side of it; <a href="../images/Greece%2016/patrick-and-miltaides-0816.jpg">that was a moment.</a></p>

<p>Our time at Olympia was wonderful, but over all to soon. Then it was off across the breadth of the Peloponnes to Nafplio and the little village of Tolo. This was where we would spend a week by and in the sea. This was <a href="../images/Greece%2016/moss-first-sea-splash-0816.jpg">Moss's first splash</a>. We stayed in what turned out to be <a href="../images/Greece%2016/house-at-tolo-0816.jpg">a great little home</a>. It didn't lok uch from the outside - or inside - but the location meant we could just fall out of bed, <a href="../images/Greece%2016/life-by-the-sea-0816.jpg">mess around  on the terrace</a> with a great view out to sea and it was an easy stroll to a host of restaurants for <a href="../images/Greece%2016/dinner-by-the-sea-0816.jpg">an evening meal</a>.</p>

<p>We drove into Nafplio one day. There was <a href="../images/Greece%2016/sweet-heaven-0816.jpg">a Willy Wonka moment</a>. We knew that rain was forecast - which was why we'd avoided the beach - but we were taken aback by <a href="../images/Greece%2016/and-then-it-rained-0816.jpg">how crazy the storm was</a>. But by the time we got back to Tolo, <a href="../images/Greece%2016/and-then-the-sun-came-out-0816.jpg">the sun was out</a>, and <a href="../images/Greece%2016/through-the-square-window-0816.jpg">life was good</a>.</p>

<p>And so the days went buy. One minute <a href="../images/Greece%2016/pedalo-0816.jpg">out on the water</a>, then <a href="../images/Greece%2016/bryhers-ice-cream-0816.jpg">scoffing some ice cream</a>, then explorig the garden for <a href="../images/Greece%2016/bryher-millipede-0816.jpg">exotic bugs</a>.</p>

<p>On one amazingly sunny day, we went out on a boat trip. the boat was <a href="../images/Greece%2016/the-eros-0816.jpg">the Eros</a>, and it was run by a great family. We got on well with the hosts who really looked after us. <a href="../images/Greece%2016/all-on-deck-0816.jpg">We sailed arouund the Gulf of Nafplio</a> and stopped in on the west to allow everyone to <a href="../images/Greece%2016/family-lunch-swim-0816.jpg">get out and snorkel</a>. There was a set of steps on one side that acted as a great diving platform and I was lucky to get <a href="../images/Greece%2016/patrick-dives-0816.jpg">this shot of Patrick</a> doing a lovely dive. The girls were <a href="../images/Greece%2016/bryher-sarah-0816.jpg">having a lovely time</a> too :) On the way back, we stopped off at another island for some more snorkelling and Bryher made <a href="../images/Greece%2016/bryher-jumps-0816.jpg">a brave leap</a> off the steps! It felt like we were getting used to the pace of <a href="../images/Greece%2016/three-boys-on-a-boat-0816.jpg">life by the sea</a>.</p>

<p>It had been a truly amazing holiday. I don't know if I ever expected to experience the joy of going snorkelling in crystal clear water, full of fish, with my whole family, never mind having it right on the front door step! But all too soon it was over, and as we crossed <a href="../images/Greece%2016/corinth-canal-0816.jpg">the Corinth Canal,</a> we looked back on what had been a great adventure.</p>
