<p>Despite the emergence of the new Omicron variant, we decided to cram in one last day trip before Christmas and headed <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-01.jpeg">down to London</a>.</p>

<p>We headed down to the river and got on <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-02.jpeg">the new Uberboat</a>. It really is <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-03.jpeg">the best way to see London</a>.</p>

<p>We took the boat from St.George's Wharf in Vauxhall all the way down <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-04.jpeg">to Greenwich</a>. It was a cold day and we were all very happy to get into the excellent <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-05.jpeg">Coach and Horses</a> in Greenwich Market. After a great lunch, we climbed up the hill to the Royal Observatory, home of <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-06.jpeg">the Greenwich Meridian</a>! Other meridians are available, but this is <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-07.jpeg">the original and best</a> :) The views from up there are wonderful, especially on <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-08.jpeg">an atmospheric winter's day</a> like this one. I've never seen it drop, but this is <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-09.jpeg">the original Greenwich time signal</a>. Sarah was <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-10.jpeg">loving it all</a> :) We took in <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-11.jpeg">a fabulous planetarium show</a>, with the excellent Greg the Astronomer, before heading back down in the dusky light to Greenwich.</p>

<p>It was dark when we got back down into Greenwich and the Cutty Sark <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-12.jpeg">looked very splendid</a>. We got back on our boat and headed back upstream, under <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-13.jpeg">the dazzling Tower Bridge</a>, and got off at Embankment.</p>

<p>Due to Omicron, most of the theatres had closed their doors that week. We were very lucky and managed to rebook for a production at the Royal Opera House called <i>The Wolf, the Witch, the Giant and the Fairy</i>. We had no idea what it would be like, but <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-14.jpeg">as soon as the curtain went up</a>, the quality of the production was clear to see and it just got better as it went on. the production company was called <i>Little Bulb</i> and we will certainly look out for them next year.</p>


 
<p>We stayed in a very handy hotel in Holborn, just round from the British Museum. So the next morning was spent there and then on into Covent Garden. We finished up with a lovely lunch at <a href="../images/London-21/london-1221-15.jpeg">the wonderful Lamb & Flag</a>, an old hauunt of Charles Dickens, so very fitting for the season. </p>
