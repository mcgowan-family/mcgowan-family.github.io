<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Ilfracombe - Summer 2012</H1>
</DIV>

<P>We popped down to Devon for what we thought would probably be our last beach break of the summer. Sarah found a nice little cottage just to the east of Ilfracombe, as the van was in Hulin's having the valves done. It was a great choice, as a working farm with animal feeding time for the kids and its <a href="../images/Family/devon-0912-01.jpg">own private beach</a>. The sand was just right for <a href="../images/Family/devon-0912-02.jpg">making sand castles</a> :)</P>

<p>Sarah was in <a href="../images/Family/devon-0912-03.jpg">her happy place</a> and <a href="../images/Family/devon-0912-04.jpg">Patrick and Bryher</a> loved it.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure <a href="../images/Family/devon-0912-05.jpg">what Bryher was looking for</a> in this rockpool, but it must have got a fright when she found it.</p>

<p>After all the excitement of the beach, we deaded in to Ilfracombe the next day. We both really liked the town around the harbour, which was a complete contrast to our last experience a lifetime ago at the Paradise Cafe :)</p>

<p>As is traditional, we treated the kids to some special ice creams. Not sure if <a href="../images/Family/devon-0912-06.jpg">Patrick really liked his</a>.</p>
