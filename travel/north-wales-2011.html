<P>Michael and Geraldine will be heading out to New Zealand at the end of the year. As an early nod to that, we had a bit of <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-01.jpg">a lads weekend</a> in North Wales in July. Chris, Michael, Brian and Gerry came down from Glasgow and I came up from Cheltenham.</P>

<P>They were a day ahead of me, and had already had some good sport at Coed y Brenin and Gerry checked out the fishing holes.</P>

<P>Our next outing, was to Tryfan, a hill I had spectacularly failed to climb in all my years in North Wales. We headed up <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-02.jpg">the North Ridge</a> with all its <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-03.jpg">amazing rock outcrops</a>.</P>

<P>It was a superb day out, with great weather and great views. This is <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-04.jpg">Michael and Chris on the summit</a> and me <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-05.jpg">mucking about on Adam & Eve</a>.</P>

<P>On our last day, we headed up to Betws y Coed (aka Betsy) and split the fun evenly between biking and fishing again. Gerry went and hassled the local salmon population and the rest of us had great fun on the Marin Trail. As is always the case, we <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-06.jpg">faffed about a bit</a> at the start, just to get in the mood.</P>

<P>I had a bit too much fun at one point and washed out on one of the bermed corners. The scars are only just gone now. <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-08.jpg">But looks like Brian didn't get enough fun</a> :)</P>

<p>Just to prove that he still could, <a href="../images/Family/north-wales-0711-07.jpg">Gerry swung his leg over the cross bar</a>. Will it be another 10 years till the next time?</p>


<p>A really nice weekend. Look forward to the reunion in South Island!</p>
