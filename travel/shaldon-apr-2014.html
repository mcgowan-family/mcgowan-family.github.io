</DIV>

<P>Sarah booked a week for us in Devon in April. We hadn't heard of Shaldon before, but it turned out to be <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-1-0414.jpg">the loveliest little place</a> down on the South Devon coast.</P>

<p><a href="../images/UK/shaldon-2-0414.jpg">The kids took their bikes</a>, and for the first time, we could all go for a walk at a normal pace.</p>

<p>It was Easter, and there was lots of <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-3-0414.jpg">egg hunt fun.</a>This was us <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-14-0414.jpg">making Easter eggs</a>. Bryher and Patrick seem to enjoy striking <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-4-0414.jpg">a moody pose</a>. Then it was <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-5-0414.jpg">girls together</a>.</p>

<p>We bumped into <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-6-0414.jpg">little Henry Haddock </a>and his Mum & Dad. Turns out they're Shaldon regulars.</p>

<p>They have <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-7-0414.jpg">the oldest passenger ferries in England</a> in Shaldon. And <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-8-0414.jpg">we got to ride them</a> nearly every day.</p>

<p>We were just down the rail line from <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-9-0414.jpg">the section that was washed out</a> at Dawlish.</p>

<p>We parked up the van and then didn't drive it for a week. Spent the whole time going for <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-12-0414.jpg">lovely walks</a>,  <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-10-0414.jpg">playing on the beach</a>, having <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-11-0414.jpg">picnics on the beach</a> and just <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-13-0414.jpg">basking in the warm glow</a> of some lovely spring sunshine.</p>

<p>To round it off, we stopped off at <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-15-0414.jpg">a theme park</a> on the way home. It was torture really, but <a href="../images/UK/shaldon-16-0414.jpg">the kids loved it</a> :)</p>
