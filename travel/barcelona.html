<P>Popped across to Barcelona with Sarah for a week in mid March. We were going to go on the bike, but figured that by the time we got there, we'd just need to turn around and come back. One for a longer break maybe.</P>

<P>We stayed right in the centre of the city on the border between <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/lanes-1.jpg">the old</A> and <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/carrer-pelai.jpg">the new</A> town. A lot of time was spent <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/alley.jpg">just wandering</A> round the city taking in the positive vibe and the great architecture.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/boqueria-1.jpg">boqueria market</A> was just round from the hotel off Las Ramblas. Amazing displays of <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/boqueria-2.jpg">fruit & veg</A>, meat, <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/boqueria-3.jpg">fish</A> and all sorts of sweets and baked stuff were everywhere. Vibrant atmosphere!  </P>

<P>Beyond the new town (known as the Eixample), the town rises up towards the Parc Guell. This was one of the first bits of Gaudi that we got exposed to. Again, a really great atmosphere and just fun to wander round the park checking out the sights. There was unexpected widlife in the form of <A HREF="../images/wildlife/gordon.jpg">geckos</A> on the rocks and parrakeets in the trees. It was St.Patricks day, so <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/parc-guell-1.jpg">this bit of ceramics</A> on the bench around the main terrace seemed appropriate. Everyone seems to love <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/parc-guell-2.jpg">the columned hall</A>.</P>

<P>One of the key sights is the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-9.jpg">Sagrada Familia</A>. We spent hours there. It's still a building site and will be for many years to come, but <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-1.jpg">what a building site</A>! </P>

<P>The details are amazing, here are some of them:</P>

<LI>the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-2.jpg">spiral stairs</A></LI>
<LI>the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-3.jpg">stained glass</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-4.jpg">statue of St.Ignatius</A>, way up on the wall of the nave</LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-5.jpg">harvest fruits</A> bursting from the tops of towers</LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-6.jpg">detail of stonework</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-7.jpg">detail of face</A> emerging from brass doors on the Passion facade</LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Barcelona/sagrada-familia-8.jpg">St.Peter</A>, by Subirachs, on the Passion facade</LI>


<P>We did get out of town for one day and headed up to the monastery of Montserrat. Nice walk up to a high point on the mountain (although you wouldn't know it by the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/montserrat-1.jpg">street style</A> :o) and then rushed back to see <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/montserrat-2.jpg">the basilica</A> and catch the last train home.</P>

<P>Every street seemed to have fabulous examples of the Modernism architecture. <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/mila-1.jpg">Much of it</A> seems <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/mila-3.jpg">futuristic</A> now, it's hard to imagine what the locals made of <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/mila-2.jpg">these chimneys</A> on casa Mila when they were built in the early 1900's. Great examples of <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/amatler.jpg">stained glass</A> in a lot of the buildings.</P>

<P>But the best bit was just wandering around, checking out the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/lanes-3.jpg">lanes in the old town</A>, the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/lanes-4.jpg">funky old shops</A>, the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/lanes-2.jpg">funky new shops</A>, the <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/lanes-5.jpg">local communities</A> and the many, many <A HREF="../images/Barcelona/lanes-6.jpg">coffee shops and bars</A> :o)</P>
