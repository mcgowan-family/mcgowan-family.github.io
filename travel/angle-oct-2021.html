<p>Due to Covid, we didn't get away for a long summer holiday, but we had been away at Easter and we decided to go away again at the half-term break in October. Sarah found a wonderful place to stay in furthest west Wales, <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-00.jpeg">the Rocket Cart House</a> in Angle. It was a historic old place, having been the coast guard look out, and the home of the rescue teams who would launch breeches buoys by rocket to rescue sailors wrecked on the rocks around the headland.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful place to stay, for parents and children. One of the best bits was the sleeping accomodation for the kids - it was all in the tower! First you went <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-01.jpeg">up the ladder</a> into <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-02.jpeg">Bryher and Moss's bedroom</a>, then up the next ladder into <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-03.jpeg">Patrick's bedroom</a>, and the final ladder took you to <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-pano.jpeg">that incredible view</a> from the roof. </p>

<p>Coming in through Pembroke, we noticed that it was all set up for <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-04.jpeg">a street fair</a>. This turned out to be the annual Michaelmas Fair, which had to be cancelled in 2020. So there was <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-05.jpeg">lots of excitemnt</a>! Moss looks <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-06.jpeg">pretty pleased</a> with his choice :) </p>

<p>But this trip was characterised more by wonderful, wild countryside and walks on the beaches. Freshwater West is a famous beach just next to the Rocket Tower and also the last resting place of <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-07.jpeg">a certain free elf</a>. This beach also held incredible sea life in its rock pools, including these lovely little <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-08.jpeg">Cushion Stars</a>.</p>

<p>Pembroke is full of history, nowhere more so than at <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-09.jpeg">Pembroke Castle</a>. This is the incredible <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-14.jpeg">undercroft</a>, that goes back to the neolithic period, but was incorporated into the castle. We did a few walks around the headland and this is <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-11.jpeg">Patrick looking westwards</a> to sea from Henry VIII's cannon emplacements at East Blockhouse.</p>


 
<p>But it was the landscape that set the tone. Whether it was <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-10.jpeg">the sun setting over Freshwater</a>, or just sitting in <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-12.jpeg">the amazing window seat</a> and watching the boats and the birds fly past in the blustery breeze. </p>

<p>After a wild and windy week, it was time to head home. We stopped off at Tenby on the way back, which I had never visited, but for some reason thought was a slightly tacky destination. It was certainly busy, but no number of visitors could spoil <a href="../images/Angle-21/angle-13.jpeg">the amazing views</a> of such an intersting location .</p>
