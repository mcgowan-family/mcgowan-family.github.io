<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Winter Holiday, Mar Lodge, Braemar 2024</H1>
</DIV>

<p>We headed north in early Feb and spent a nice evening with Maureen & Gerry in Milngavie.The Premier Inn by the West of Scotland ground is a good stopping point. We popped in to see Ashliegh and Geraldine in the morning, then headed up the road.</p>

<p>Moss had a damaged wheel on his little Isla Cnoc 16, so we dropped that off with Big Al at Wheelcraft <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-00.jpeg">in Campsie Glen</a>, with a plan to pick it up on the way back down. The weather was lovely. As the Falkirk Wheel was closed for renovation, we headed over to <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-01.jpeg">the wonderful Kelpies</a> for a quick stop.</p>

<p>Travelling north, the hoped for dump of snow hadn't really delivered. But there was a nice dusting as we went over Glen Shee and dropped down to Braemar. The idea of staying in the Bunkhouse at Mar Lodge was a bit of a shot in the dark, but as we turned onto <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-02.jpeg">Victoria Bridge over the Dee</a>, it had a special feel.</p>


<p>This version of Mar Lodge was built in 1895 to be the hunting lodge for the Earl of Fife and Princess Louisa, the grand-daughter of Queen Victoria. The land of Dalmore, was originaaly in the hands of the Mackenzie Clan, but had passed from them to the Earl of Fife in the late 18th century. It is <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-03.jpeg">an incredible building</a> in an amazing setting. We were staying in the Bunkhouse, which is one wing of the old stable block. It was a vast space for the five of us and the kids found it a little spooky at first :)</p>


<p>The day we travelled up was Sarah's birthday. There aren't many dining options in Braemar on a winter's evening, but I had managed to get us the best table in the fabulous Fife Arms. Sarah seemed <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-04.jpeg">very happy</a> with the arrangements.</p>


<p>The next morning saw an improvement in the weather as we set out to explore our esate. It was cold, bright and sunnny. This is <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-05.jpeg">the ballroom</a> of the lodge.</p>
    
    
<p>We headed <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-06.jpeg">up and away</a> from the lodge, towards the western flanks of Creag Bhalg. The trail and landscape was covered with <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-07.jpeg">lovely, cold, crisp snow</a>, which made walking pretty easy. We brought supplies and had <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-08.jpeg">a picnic under this granny pine</a>. At the highest point of the trail and <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-09.jpeg">looking north towards Beinn Bhreac</a>, a Golden Eagle appeared from the shoulder of Creag Bhalg and headed north where we watched it hunting over Meall an Lundain - wonderful!</p>
    
     
<p>We dropped down to <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-10.jpeg">the bridge over the Lui Water</a>.The kids had a big snowball fight, we <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-11.jpeg">took in the view</a> and Moss <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-12.jpeg">made a little pal</a>. As we follwed the Lui downhill, we were treated to Scottish Crossbill, feeding in the Scots Pine overhead. We dropped right down to the river to <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-13.jpeg">explore a waterfall</a> and the kids got a taste of <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-14.jpeg">real Highland spring water</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>We reached the road where the Lui Water joins <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-15.jpeg">the Dee</a>. We followed <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-16.jpeg">a nice wee trail</a>, west, upstream along the riverbank.Soon we reached the Linn of Dee, <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-17.jpeg">draped in ice</a>. Patrick had never seen <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-18.jpeg">anything like this</a> before. The light was still good and we took in the views <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-19.jpeg">west from the Linn of Dee</a> up towards White Bridge.</p>

<p>After a good night's sleep and hearty bowl of porridge for breakfast, we headed east this time, towards Glen Quoich. The ranger team had suggested there might even by White-tailed Eagle in Glen Quoich! Patrick was making sure he <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-20.jpeg">didn't overdo it</a>, but we were all amazed by the Linn of Quoich and <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-21.jpeg">the Punchbowl</a>. Moss is looking <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-22.jpeg">a little alarmed here</a>.</p> 

    
<p>We hiked a good way up the glen, but as the afternoon started to get on we turned back and headed towards the lodge in <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-23.jpeg">a lovely fading light</a>. As a wonderful finale to the day, just as we rounded the bottom of the glen, I spotted <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-24.jpeg">a White-tailed Eagle</a>, settled down for the night, high on the flank of Creag Bhalg. What an amazing end to the day!</p>
    
    
<p>The next day wasn't quite as bright, so we decided to head up to Glen Shee to see if there was any skiing to be had. It was a bit of a sad affair, with a scrap of snow covered in very damp beginners down near the roadside. But <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-25.jpeg">Glen Clunie looked lovely in the mist</a> as we dropped back towards Braemar. Lovely views of Red Deer and Red Grouse on the way back down.</p>

    
<p>Heading west back up to Mar Lodge, Dalmore looked incredible with <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-26.jpeg">the trees draped in a cloak of mist</a>. We stood outside the stable block and watched <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-27.jpeg">the sun set behind the Lodge</a>. We were <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-28.jpeg">sad to leave</a> what now felt like <i>our</i> bunkhouse. We got a sneeky preview of <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-29.jpeg">the interior of the ballroom</a> and then we were off.</p>
    
<p>The trip back was far less snowy than the way up. I was pleased to be able to show the kids <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-30.jpeg">the world's tallest hedge</a> at Meikleour. What I didn't know, was that it was allegedly planted by men who never returned from the 1745 rebelion, and was left as a living memorial to them!</p>
    
    
<p>We headed back towartds Glasgow and stopped in to see Brian in Lennoxtown - he was delighted! And we even managed to pick up <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-31.jpeg">Mossy's first hand-built wheel</a> by Big Al! What an amazing trip. I'm sure we will head back to Mar Lodge :)</p>
