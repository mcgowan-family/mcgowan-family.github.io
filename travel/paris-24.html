<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>A Summer break in Paris and Eurodisney!! July 2024</H1>
</DIV>

<p>I never had Disneyland on  my bucket list, but it turms out the magic is for everyone :)</p>

<p>We caught the ferry over to Calais and headed down the Autoroute des Anglais. We got to the Airbnb late i eth evening, but happily there were spome lovely restaurants nearby, including <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-01.jpeg">this Lebanese one</a>. Sarah had found a really nice apartment in the district known as Val d'Europe, just one stop west along the RER A from Disneyland</p>

<p>We spent a lovely first day wandering round Paris. This is Moss, taking some time out <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-02.jpeg">by the side of the Seine</a>. We wandered north from the river, <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-03.jpeg">stopping off at Les Halles</a> for a drink.</p>


<p>I had always wanted to go back to <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-04.jpeg">the Restaurant Chartier</a>, to let the kids see some real Paris. It was a place i went for lunch when i travelled through Paris as a student. Our route north took us right past it, <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-05.jpeg">so we stopped in</a> :) It was really wonderful <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-06.jpeg">to share the memory</a>, but I won't order pig's trotters again :)</p>


<p>We wandered all the way up to <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-07.jpeg">Sacre Couer</a> and then made our way back down to the river and along to <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-08.jpeg">the Eiffel Tower</a>. Our visit coincided with the Olympics, which meant <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-09.jpeg">the City of Lights</a> was even more decorated than normal.</p>


<p>The next day was a early start before heading to <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-10.jpeg">The Magical Kingdom</a>!.</p>
    
    
<p>I wnjoyed Eurodisney much more than I expected. There really was <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-11.jpeg">something for everyone</a>. It was another very long day, but everyone coped well with it <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-12.jpeg">and had a lot of fun</a>. Moss even managed to <a href="../images/Paris-24/paris-24-13.jpeg">get some air</a>!</p>

<p>The day finsihed with an amazing light show over the Castle. We spent a couple of days at the park before making our way back home. Tired asnd happy. </p>
