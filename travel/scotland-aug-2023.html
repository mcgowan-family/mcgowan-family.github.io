<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Summer Road Trip, Scotland 2023</H1>
</DIV>

<p>In what I hope remains an annual event, me and Moss <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-1.jpeg">took a road trip</a> in the van to Scotland.</p>

<p>We had no stops on the way up this time and went straight to Glasgow, where we stayed with Maureen and Gerry. A new feature this year, was a visit to <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-4.jpeg">the working farm</a>. Moss mucked in, got <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-2.jpeg">a ride in the back</a> of the truck and helped <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-3.jpeg">round up the sheep</a>.</p>

<p>I headed out to Lennoxtown to see Brian in his new accommodation at the care home there. Our visit coincided with the men's elite race coming down the Crow Road as part of the UCI World Championships. <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-5.jpeg">Quite a sight</a>!</p>


<p>We headed down to Adrossan to see <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-6.jpeg">Gerry's new boat</a>. The sea air worked up an appetite, so we <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-7.jpeg">grabbed some lunch</a> and used some of the leftovers as crab bait. It turn's out crabs <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-8.jpeg">love square slice</a>!</p>


<p>After some emergency electrical repairs on the van, the next day saw us heading up into the Highlands. We <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-9.jpeg">stopped off at Loch Sloy</a> briefly for a bit of an explore, then met up with Gerry at Taynuilt. It was  a lovely day and Gerry decided to fulfil an ambition to <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-10.jpeg">fly a kite</a>, while Moss <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-11.jpeg">explored the foreshore</a> of Loch Etive. There was just time for <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-12.jpeg">a spot of fishing</a> before we headed off to Oban to catch the last ferry to Oban. Mossy certainly enjoyed <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-13.jpeg">his fish supper</a>. I don't think I got too many of these!</p>


<p>We arrived very late in the evening into Craignure in Mull. We were heading south west towarsd Iona. THat took us up into the hills of Glen More, where a large deer hind came over for a close look at Moss in the van. It looked right in his open window! Just as light was failing, we found a lovely layby <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-14.jpeg">on the shores of Loch Scridain</a>, next to Pennyghael. </p>
    
    
<p>It had been many years since I had last set foot on Iona. I always think of it as quite a magical place, and this visit was no different. We took the bikes across on the CalMac ferry and rode over to the west side of the island to <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-15.jpeg">the beautiful beach</a> of Camus Cul an Taibh (the Bay on the Back of the Ocean).  To my surpise, there is a golf course over there on the machair. We took an adventurous off road route on the bikes which <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-16.jpeg">Moss wasn't convinced of</a>. We then headed up to the far north of the island and set up camp on the <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-17.jpeg">even more stunning beach</a> of Traigh Ban nam Manach (the White Strand of the Monks). Moss was in his element and I couldn't resist doing a <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-1.mov">Chariots of Fire moment</a>.</p>
    
     
<p>Returning from Iona, we made our way to the southern coast of the Ross of Mull, to a lovely little spot called Uisken. We got the boat out and paddled out to <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-18.jpeg">a little island off the beach</a> for a spot of fishing. I reckon this is now <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-19.jpeg">my favourite secret camp spot</a>. It was certainly our favourite <a href="../images/Scotland-23/scotland-23-20.jpeg">secret camp fry up</a>!</p>
    
    
<p>We spent the whole of the next day on that lovely beach. So much so that we very nearly missed the last ferry back to the mainland, just squeaking in at teht end of the line.</p>

<p>We drove back down to Glasgow that night, rolling in late to Maureen & Gerry's. After a nice breakfast, we headed back down the road, spending the night half way down at the Gisburn Forest hub in the Forest of Bowland. I checked out some bikes at the Ribble store, but didn't buy as I couldn't get them on the Bike to Work scheme.</p>
