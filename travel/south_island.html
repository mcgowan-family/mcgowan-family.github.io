<P>Referee!!! First person to mention the six nations is in <I>serious</I> trouble.</P>

<P>I arrived in the South Island on 19 Feb. The crossing from Wellington took place in a gale, but the boats are excellent and we used the time to get some <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/web_work.jpg">email and web stuff</A> done.</P>

<P>The first night was spent in Nelson. Excellent hi-speed web connect in the Kiwi Cafe. Best food in a while was in Broccoli Row. Very tricky to find down a little lane off Hardy Street but well worth the effort.</P>

<P>From Nelson, the next stop was the <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/abel_tasman.jpg">Abel Tasman National Park</A>. You can spend a few days walking the coast trail and crossing the many sheltered coves and <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/abel_beach.jpg">beaches</A> - or get a water taxi to take you up the coast as far as you like, walk a section of the trail, then pick you up after you've had a gorgeous lunch and slumbered on the beach for an hour.</P>

<P>Then it was down the coast, through the scenic Glen Hope, into Murchison (good grub at the Rivers Cafe, through the Bullers Gorge (we stayed at the DOC site at Lyell) and onto the <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/west_coast.jpg">west coast proper</A>.</P>

<P>Halfway down the coast is the small town of Greymouth. A lot of folk come here because of the local jade trade, but the serious traveller rolls into town for the <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/monteiths.jpg">Monteiths Brewery</A> tour at 1400 on a Saturday :o)</P>

<P>Keep going and you come to the glacier region that lies to the West of <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/mt_cook.jpg">Mount Cook</A>. To the north is Franz Joseph Glacier and to the south Fox Glacier. Gillespies Beach is a great place to camp up for the night. Another one for Michelle, not a Bush Baby, but a <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/possum.jpg">possum's</A> pretty close. They're a pest in New Zealand and they pop up all over the place - most often as roadkill :o0</P>


<P>The next few days we spent in Queenstown. I went water surfing, luging and mountain biking. In the years to come, uplift for downhill bikes woudl become common. Having decided to bike up to the top of the cable car, <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/fern_hill.jpg">I'm reflecting</A> on what a good idea this is. </P>

<P>River surfing is pretty good. I  did nothing bigger than class 3 rapids, but whenever you're at and below water level, that feels pretty big. You can pull bow rolls off waves, catch the wave and surf it (opposite of the sea, you need to stop still and match your up-river speed to that of the standing wave) and look out for areas of subverting water (two bodies of water meet and dive down) to <I>squirt</I> - this involves ducking your level board under water, the water catches it and pulls you under and along for the ride. Hold it for as long as you can then point the board up and head for the surface. Chris the instructor gave us the most important lesson of all - how to hold the board while walking down to the river under the watchful eyes of other tourists - "Hold it like this and you look cool. If you look cool you feel cool and if you feel cool you are cool." Got to work that into my next job.</P>

<P>The mountain biking is amazing. Rent a bike from one of the stores in town and slog up the gondola access road. Fifty quid to anyone who can ride the whole thing. First descent was from the gondola station - bone jarring downhill and really loose trail. I was so knackered after the first climb that I decided to take the bike up on the gondola for the second run. Unfortunately they no longer allow bikes on the gondola to discourage 'all the gear - no idea' candidates from killing themselves on the downhill. So second ascent involved more hiking than biking. This time I went out the Fernhill Loop - climb above the stream and reverse the trail back to the Skyline trail for the biggest rush yet on a bike. High speed, technical single track, jumps, big drop-offs and the scenery's pretty good too.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/South%20Island/kea.jpg">Kea</A> is what happens when a good bird turns bad. A gang of four tried to break into the van through the roof. This bird waited till your back was turned then tried to steal your shoelaces.</P>

<P>Arrived in Milford Sound after an amazing journey from Te Anau. It is the most scenic bit of road we've been on so far, with <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/the_divide.jpg">crystal clear streams</A> cascading down steep cliffs and gorges by the roads edge. One of the very few places to stay is the Milford Lodge, which is a decent and well run backpackers place. </P>

<P>The Mitre Peak boat on Milford Sound is a great experience. It was recommended by the lodge as the best boat for independent travellers and worked out well. The first European to discover the entry to the sound was a Welshman. This accounts for the name of the Sound and a lot of the local spots. The Sound is <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/milford_sound.jpg">a tremendous fiord</A> with wonderful <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/milford_fall.jpg">waterfalls</A> cascading down and fantastic <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/mt_pembroke.jpg">alpine peaks</A> soaring above. Definitely worth the trip out from Te Anau.</P>

<P>From Milford Sound, the route took us across the country to Dunedin and the Otago Peninsula, which is where we are now. Dunedin is a Victorian era university town with plenty of nightlife and the peninsula is home to a large variety of wildlife, like this <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/fur_seal.jpg">Southern Fur Seal</A>.</P>

<P>In contrast to Queenstown, which feels like Chamonix or Vail, a lot of NZ feels like the UK of 30 years ago. Morris and Wolseley cars are more common than they have any right to be, the shops are smaller and less brash and the bars are a nostalgia trip to the British seaside of the 70s. Tonights fish & chips cost 80p and were wrapped in newspaper. Excellent.</P>


<P>From Dunedin, the route was inland to Lake Tekapo. A night on the lake shore, then a gentle run down to Christchurch.</P>

<P>On the way, we passed through <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/geraldine.jpg">Geraldine</A>. You will both be pleased to hear that you have a population of 2325, a lively crafts scene and a stonkin' chippie.</P>

<P>Another surprise, was Mrs.Mac who makes <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/mrs_mac.jpg">surprisingly good meat pie</A>.</P>

<P>Christchurch is billed as the most English of New Zealand's towns; we must have caught it on a bad day. Apart from the odd spot, like the <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/antigua.jpg">Antigua boat yard</A> it  seemed a bit run down and of course it was raining - maybe that's what they meant. It's a nice enough place with great atmosphere,  seafood and veggie fare at Dux de Lux; but I wouldn't make a detour.</P>

<P>A much nicer option, is to drive out to <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/akaroa_harbour.jpg">Akaroa Harbour</A> on the Banks Peninsula. Founded by the French and still retaining some of their influence (albeit a bit commercialised), this lovely spot is worth a couple of days. Kick back and <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/akaroa_boat_club.jpg">watch a yacht race</A>, have <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/boule.jpg">a game of boules</A> or watch the deciding 5th race in the America's Cup. Victory to Alinghi, Coutts and Butterworth - a national disaster for New Zealand.</P>

<HR>

</P>There was a storm from the east last night and a massive tree was knocked down next to the van in the campsite. <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/tree_attack.jpg">The tree fell on the tent</A> of the bloke camped nextdoor. Fortunately, he had been woken by the storm and was at the other end of the tent trying to make some tea! He was very relaxed about the whole event this morning - "Yeah, that was a bit lucky eh.". His car is under there somewhere as well.</P>

<P>This is our last day in New Zealand, where even <A HREF="../images/South%20Island/barbie_bungy.jpg">Barbie bungys</A>. Next update is likely to be from Oz.</P>
