<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>The Top End, 2003</H1>
</DIV>

<P>I arrived in Darwin on 10 March, 2003</P>

<P>While in Darwin, we stayed at the excellent <I>Steeles of Larrakeyah</I>, run by Janette and Roger Steele. Janette and Roger are lovely people and made sure we knew our way around before letting us loose on the town and the Territory.</P>


<P>Darwin was wiped off the map back in 1974 when Cyclone Tracy came to town. It's been 4 years since a cyclone has threatened the town, so it was surprising to  find out that Cyclone Craig was paying a visit to coincide with our arrival. In the end, Craig only let his coat-tails brush the town and it was just a bit windy.</P>

<P>Darwin has an excellent museum that covers all the key elements of the Top End. While there, they were unveiling <I>Haystacks</I> by Monet. This was apparently the first time a European old master had ever been exhibited in the Northern territory. On the surface, the place feels connected to the rest of the planet, but this was an interestinng indicator of how remote the area can be.</P>

<P>Once the weather calmed down, it was time to see Kakadu National Park. <A HREF="../images/Top_End/kakadu.jpg">Kakadu</A> is definitely worth seeing, but I would recommend avoiding the wet (aka the southern summer) as much of the park is under water and inaccessible. </P>

<P>Highlights are the wildlife, the <A HREF="../images/Top_End/rock_art_1.jpg">aboriginal rock art</A> and the landscapes.</P>

<P>Nourlangie was the only accesible rock art site and <A HREF="../images/Top_End/rock_art_2.jpg">this image</A> shows Namargonn the Lightning Maker hanging with some of his Dreamtime mates.</P>

<P>Wildlife is everywhere. This <A HREF="../images/Top_End/termite_mound.jpg">Cathedral Termite mound</A> was the Sears Tower of the insect world; this <A HREF="../images/Top_End/frilled_lizard.jpg">Frilled Lizard</A> was goood enough to hang around long enough for a pic; and this <A HREF="../images/Top_End/saltie.jpg">saltwater croc</A> (known locally as a saltie) was just waiting for something to swim into his mouth at <A HREF="../images/Top_End/yellow_water.jpg">Yellow Water</A>.</P>

<P>After Kakadu, we headed south to Katherine and the gorge of the same name. The <A HREF="../images/Top_End/katherine_gorge.jpg">Katherine Gorge</A> is another must see in the region. As you set out from the boat ramp, <A HREF="../images/Top_End/fruit_bats.jpg">the skies fill</A> with shrieking red and black fruit bats. The high water levels had meant that no boat trips had been allowed through the gorge for the previous 5 weeks.This was the first trip up the river since then. The water levels were still very high and we could only travel as far as <A HREF="../images/Top_End/katherine_gorge_2.jpg">the entry to the second gorge</A>. </P>

<P>Back at the park visitor centre, there was a touch of the Barbara Cartlands about the eye-makeup on this <A HREF="../images/Top_End/blue_faced_honeyeater.jpg">honeyeater</A>.</P>

</P>I had heard a lot about road trains before setting out on this trip. These massive artic's are unique to Oz and thunder along the outback highways. <A HREF="../images/Top_End/road_train.jpg">This particular one</A> was pullling 4 separate petrol containers. As Fletch will have discovered by now, this would be the ideal attachment to the Grand Cherokee and avoid the need to plan journeys based on the location of gas stations.</P>
