</DIV>

<P>We decided to get away for a break and Sarah booked a lovely little cottage in the oldest part of Barmouth known as <i>the Rock</i>. Moss was so excited he couldn't go to bed and <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-01.jpg">fell asleep on the landing</a>. The journey up was easy and full of new sights, like this <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-02.jpg">old toll bridge</a> at Penmaenpool.</P>

<p>We were lucky with the weather and <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-03.jpg">spent much of the week on beaches</a>. Barmouth has a <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-04.jpg">bit of a Glastonbury feel</a> to it. <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-05.jpg">But with Waltzers</a>! Moss wasn't convinced about that one (!) so <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-06.jpg">sat out the next ride</a>. This was <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-07.jpg">more his thing</a> :)</p>

<p>Back on the beach and Bryher was striking <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-08.jpg">one of her theme poses</a>.  There was plenty of <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-09.jpg">lovely Sea Holly</a> everywhere.</p>

<p>One of the things that attracted us to north Wales was <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-10.jpg">Harlech Castle</a>, which Patrick had studied in school. Sadly we could only admire it from outside due to Covid, but that was impressive enough and we will surely be back. </p>

<p>We spent the only damp day, doing a tour of Snowdonia. This is <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-11.jpg">the Pont-y-Pair bridge</a> over the Conwy in Betws-y-Coed. We got to relive early childhood memories for Sarah on <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-12.jpg">the Blaennau Ffestiniog Railway</a>. It was <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-13.jpg">a lovely day</a> and a <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-14.jpg">great way to see the countryside</a>.</p>

 
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-15.jpg">back at the beach</a>, <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-16.jpg">Moss and Bryher went crabbing</a>. We even convinced the kids to climb up the hill behind the cottage <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-17.jpg">to Dinas Oleu</a>, the very first National Trust property donated by Mrs Fanny Talbot in 1895. Followed by <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-18.jpg">a bit more crabbing for Patrick</a>!</p>

<p>We spent one long day riding on boats and trains across the estuary to Fairbourne. First you <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-19.jpg">cross the Mawddach estuary</a> on the old wooden rail bridge. Then take <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-20.jpg">the little steam train</a> from Fairbourne (the first place in the UK that will be sacrificed to rising sea levels) back up to<a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-21.jpg"> the spit of shingle directly across from Barmouth</a>. Before taking a little boat back across the Mawddach into Barmouth.</p>

<p>Patrick and me <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-22.jpg">finally got to go fishing</a>!</p>

<p>We rounded off the trip by <a href="../images/Barmouth-20/barmouth-23.jpg">stopping off at Mark and Vic's</a> in Coed Devonald by Eglwyswrw in Pembrokeshire.</p>
