<P>We flew to South Island from <A HREF="singapore-2008.html">Singapore</A>. We were at the end of 4 hot and humid days, so decided to go <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/crowne%20plaza.jpg">easy on the camping</A> to start off. Christchurch is a good intro to the spirit of South Island - small town feel and friendly folk. <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/johnsons.jpg">Mr Johnson's grocery store</A> was a good example.</P>

<P>We picked up <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/van2.jpg">the van</A> and headed south down the east coast and stopped at Moeraki to check out the weird <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/mauraki1.jpg">beach boulders</A>. Look like something that <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/mauraki2.jpg">dropped out of space</A>. We also stumbled on the amazing <A HREF="http://www.fleursplace.com/">Fleurs</A> restaurant - and <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/fleurs.jpg">Sarah did finish this</A>. It was also a great start to the wildlife that would be such a feature of South Island - these are <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/shags.jpg">Spotted Shags</A>.</P>

<P>Next stop was the Otago Peninsula. <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/otago1.jpg">Deserted beaches</A>, <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/otago2.jpg">tired little boys</A> and a female <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/otago3.jpg">Hooker's sea lion</A>. After a few days around Dunedin, we headed on down the coast to the remote Catlins area. The amazing <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/nugget%20rock.jpg">Nugget Rocks</A> were the gateway and <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/catlins.jpg">great walks </A>up the Catlins River followed. We stayed at a remote DoC campsite by <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/catlins2.jpg">the Catlins River</A>, then drove on down the coast, past <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/catlins3.jpg">remote, empty beaches</A>, through <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/catlins4.jpg">a wonderful sunset</A> and rocked up in the curious town that is Invercargill. At least <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/patrick%20rapper.jpg">it made Patrick smile</A>.</P>

<P>Next, it was time to head north west into Fiordland. By now we had <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/van1.jpg">a good system</A> going in the van. We headed up past Te Anau into the amzing <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/eglinton.jpg">Eglinton Vallley</A>. We passed over the continental divide at the Homer Tunnel and had our first encounter with <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/kea.jpg">the fiesty Kea</A>. This one had a go at me for trying to scare it off a car it was busy wrecking! We dropped down into Milford and were very lucky to get the last room at the Mitre Lodge (normally reserved for those walking the Milford Track). It meant we could make an early start on a trip onto the Sound with great views of <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/milford1.jpg">Mitre Peak in the mist</A>, then with <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/milford2.jpg">early light of morning</A>. Actually it was very early light and I was <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/milford3.jpg">pretty tired</A> come the afternoon.</P>

<P>We headed north from Milford, through Queenstown and Wanaka before rocking up in Fox Glacier. We stayed in a nice little motel, checked out Gillespie's Beach (very spooky by moonlight) and then were very fortunate to get <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/cook1.jpg">amazing views</A> of Mounts Cook and Tasman from lake Matheson.</P>

<P>We headed up the coast from Fox to Hokitika. Picked up some nice jade pieces, then headed east up to Arthurs Pass. We had another encounter with a Kea in the campsite, where one of the little guys tried to nick the steaks that Sarah was busy cooking and I ended up chasing it round a table. Next morning we did a walk up the Otira Vallley to <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/otira.jpg">this alpine river crossing</A>.</P>

<P>Next day we dropped down east to the coast at Kaikoura. Kaikoura's a really great area for wildlife. We found loads of paua shells around here (and brought tin loads home). The sea was too rough the first day to go out on the boats, but <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/pacific.jpg">the next morning</A> dawned calm. The excitement was a bit much for these <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/fur%20seals.jpg">New Zealand fur seals</A>. I went out on an <A HREF="http://www.oceanwings.co.nz/albatross/">Albatross trip</A> which was amazing, then me and Sar went out on a whale watch. The small boats mean that no kids under 3 can go out, so we decided to part with the Muncher for a morning, which felt very strange. <A HREF="http://www.whalewatch.co.nz/">The whale trip</A> is great though. We had brilliant views of <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/sperm%20whale.jpg">Sperm Whale</A> (Wandering Albatross in distance), and finally caught up with the rare <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/hectors.jpg">Hectors dolphin</A>. We also came across a pod of over 200 <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/duskys.jpg">Dusky Dolphin</A>!! Next morning it was time to leave and head up the coast, but as it was Patrick's saints day, we stopped at a nice spot and built him <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/patricks%20stupa.jpg">this little stupa</A> to mark it.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/kiwi%20train.jpg">A train picture</A>, just for Iain :o)</P>

<P>A long drive up to the north end of South Island took us to the Abel Tasman national park. It was time for a bit of luxury and <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/abel1.jpg">we traveled by boat</A> to the amazing <A HREF="http://www.awaroalodge.co.nz/">Awaroa Lodge</A>. Abel is most famous for <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/abel2.jpg">sea kayaking</A> and for <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/abel3.jpg">the coastal path</A>. Despite the dreaded Sand Fly, <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/abel4.jpg">we had a great time</A>.</P>

<P>It was finally time to leave south island, so we headed over to Picton via the Queen Charlotte drive and took the ferry from Picton down <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/marlborough3.jpg">the Queen Charlotte Sound</A>. Patrick was <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/marlborough1.jpg">almost overwhelmed</A> by the scenery. Bottlenose Dolpin jumped across the bows <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/marlborough2.jpg">as the sun set</A> and we took our leave of South Island. Magical!</P>

<P>We arrived very late into Wellington and were lucky to find a quiet spot up by the Karori wildlife sanctuary to park up. It was at this point, that Sarah started to notice the strange coincidence that many of our campsites seemed remarkably close to nature reserves. Strange, but true.</P>

<P>From Wellington, it was a long drive north with the aim of getting close to Matamata and Sar's old college friend Mandy. It was a great drive over the desert road past <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/tongariro.jpg">the Tongariro national park</A> - great light. Sarah drove down this crazy single track gravel road for about 30 miles. Hard travelling, but the good news was that there was another national park with amazing wildlife at the end of it. Well, Patrick seemed <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/pureora.jpg">pretty happy</A>.</P>

<P>We caught up with Mandy annd Jason in Matamata. This town has become famous as the setting of Hobbiton in Lord of the Rings. Apparently it's little more than a few holes in a field, but that doesn't stop a lot of tour buses and thousands of japanese tourists making it a destination. </P>

<P>Time to move on again. This time to <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/coromandel.jpg">the Coromandel Peninsula</A>. We stayed in Thames (rubbish campsite - absolute silence from 2200!!!). Next morning we drove up the coast and over to the Hot Springs beach. It was Easter Sunday and really too busy to hang around, so we moved on to Miranda - quite a posh, but nice campsite, with its very own hot mineral springs. This was also the site of what is described as the best fish and chip shop in New Zealand, the Kaiaua Fisheries. We tried it and it was. In fact, it was the best fish supper I've ever had. I had Gurnard and Sarah had Takahini. All wrapped in newspaper and cooked fresh. Expect a wait, but it is worth it.</P>

<P>Next morning was a brisk start to get up to Half Moon bay and the ferry over to Waiheke for the wedding. All was going well until we stopped into a garage for petrol and coffee. We had 10 mins to catch the boat, but we were only a few km's away. As we pulled away from the next lights, the tailgate flapped open and our van emptied into two lanes of heavy trraffic. Amazingly there was only one serious casualty - <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/oops2.jpg">Patrick's sterilizer</A>, which ended up wedged under the car behind. Eventually we got everything back in the car, Patrick was screaming for food, Sarah was navigating on the laptop, I pulled off again and my 2 shot, fair trade, latte to go flipped off the dash and into my lap. You had to laugh.</P>

<P>Once on Waiheke, we drove straight to Onetangi Beach and found Andy and Kirsty in 5 min's. They were  doing a rehearsal for the next day. Five minutes later, we bumped into Garan and Sara! After catching up with Neil, Julie, Laura and Lucy, we headed over to what was actually the nicest campsite we stayed at the whole trip. It sits in a little unspoilt bay on the south coast of the island and looks out across the Hauraki Gulf to Aukland. Magic. It was Easter, so Partick got his first little chocolate Easter Chick. <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/easter.jpg">He pretended to be pleased</A>. </P>

<P>Next day was Andy and Kirsty's wedding. It was a really great day - the beach celebration was fabulous, <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/kirsty.jpg">the bride</A> looked gorgeous, <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/vows.jpg">the groom</A> looked weird as ever and everyone <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/oops.jpg">really got into the spirit</A>. It was a lovely ceremony, followed by a stunning reception in the <A HREF="http://www.mudbrick.co.nz/">Mud Brick vineyard</A>. Dining and dancing the night away, with a starry sky and the lights of Aukland twinkling in the distance. Not too shabby.</P>

<P>It was finally time to go, and we left Waiheke with real regret. It was the nicest spot we'd seen on North Island. We headed north up the coast and decided to stay the night near to the  marine sanctuary at <A HREF="http://www.seafriends.org.nz/issues/res/gi/">Goat Island</A>. The next morning, we headed down to the beach and I went snorkelling in what really is a great marine reserve. Lots of really big fish that calmly swim off into the rich kelp forest. Surprisingly there isn't more of this habitat around New Zealand and a number of the divers there comented that NZ is often not the "clean and green" destination the toursit board like to depict. We were on our way to Bay of Islands where we planned to spend the last night of our trip, but fortunately Sarah checked our itenerary and realised that we were meant to be returning the van in Aukland an hour ago!!! Oops. Don't Panic!!</P>

<P>So we left New Zealand in quite a rush, but in a way, that was nice. No lingering farewell, just a mad dash, <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/goat%20island.jpg">with the sand still lingering on our toes</A>.</P>

<P>We had decided not to stop over in Singapore on the way home, so that made it something like 30 hours without proper rest. But once again, the wee man <A HREF="../images/New%20Zealand%2008/homeward%20bound.jpg">took it all in his stride</A>.</P>
