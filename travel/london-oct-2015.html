<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Dinosnores and London, October, 2015</H1>
</DIV>

<P>I had been planning on taking Patrick to <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-1-1015.jpg">Dinosnores</a> ever since he was born. I'd read about it in an article of best nights out in London, but it had failed to mentione that children needed to be 7. So it had already been a long wait. We went down on the train to <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-11-1015.jpg">Paddington</a>, then straight on to catch up with all the others in South Ken.</P>

<p>It was a bit of a wait to get in, and I had no idea there would be so many kids there (like hundreds), but as soon as you were in, it was<a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-2-1015.jpg"> worth the wait</a>.</p>

<p>With so many children, at the end of their normal day, and so much excitement, the organisation has to be spot on - and it is.  We started with some great science lectures - this is <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-3-1015.jpg">Freddy Smith getting eaten by a Great White</a>. Then there was a great session about <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-4-1015.jpg">Giant Squid</a> - Patrick retained that one for ever. And finally we had to go on a dinosaur hunt - <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-6-1015.jpg">in the dark</a>! You never know <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-7-1015.jpg">what you'll find</a>!</p>


<p>By 11 or 1130, it was time for lights out and quiet. Good luck with that with <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-8-1015.jpg">this many kids</a> in a dinosaur hall. But eventually everyone did get to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning, there was time for <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-9-1015.jpg">a madcap early breakfast</a>, some cool shots <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-11-1015.jpg">in front of the NHM </a>of our crew and <a href="../images/London-15/dinosnores-12-1015.jpg">big hugs</a> for best mates.</p>


<p>Patrick and me had decided to make the most of being in London, so rather than going straight back in the morning, we had planned to spend the day there as well. We started at <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-1-1015.jpg">Monument</a>, as Patrick had wanted to see that ever since doing a school project on the Great Fire. The weather was kind and we had <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-2-1015.jpg">great views</a> all around. Once we'd got all the way back to <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-3-1015.jpg">the bottom</a>, we headed round to <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-4-1015.jpg">Covent Garden</a>. The street performers were good, but I knew Patrick would be blown away by the Apple Store as well - so many tablets you can just pick up and play!!!</p>

<p>I'd never been in <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-6-1015.jpg">M&M World</a>, so this seemed a great opportunity.  There's <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-5-1015.jpg">a lot more</a> in that store than you'd imagine. We got into a row from the staff <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-7-1015.jpg">just after this</a> :)</p>

<p>But so much more to see, so off to Trafalgar Square! Now it happened that the Rugby World Cup was in the UK that year. Trafalgar had been given over as a 'fan zone' and there was loads to do and see - including the actual <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-8-1015.jpg">Webb Ellis trophy</a>!!</p>


<p>Time was getting on now and my little lad had done brilliantly, given how little sleep he'd had. So I took him down Whitehall, past <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-9-1015.jpg">the Horse Guards</a>, past Downing Street and <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-10-1015.jpg">Big Ben</a> and back on a tube to Paddington to get back on <a href="../images/London-15/patrick-london-12-1015.jpg">our train  home</a>. What a 24 hours that had been!</p>
