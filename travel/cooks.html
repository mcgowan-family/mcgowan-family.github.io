<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Cook Islands, 2003</H1>
</DIV>
<P>I arrived in the Cooks on 3 Feb, 2003.</P>

<P>It is as gorgeous as you might imagine a South Pacific island to be.</P>

<P>Accommodation was <A HREF="../images/Cooks/villa.jpg">a little house</A> right on the beach at Muri Lagoon. The <A HREF="../images/Cooks/deck_view.jpg">view from the deck</A> is better than the one in Elko Drive and if you fancy a dip, <A HREF="../images/Cooks/taakoka.jpg">it just doesn't get any better than this</A>.</P>

<P>But it is <A HREF="../images/Cooks/cyclone.jpg">cyclone season</A>!!</P>

<P>You can do the cross island walk that climbs up to Te Rua-Manga - The Needle</P>

<P>I rented <A HREF="../images/Cooks/biker.jpg">a bike</A> for a few days to zip around the island, but the bus works really well if you prefer (or can't handle the unbridled power of a Yamaha 100cc).</P>

<P>And of course there was <A HREF="../images/Cooks/snorkel.jpg">snorkelling</A> and kayaking in the lagoon.</P>

<P>Saturday morning <A HREF="../images/Cooks/market.jpg">market</A> is a 'must see'.</P>

<P>If you ever find your way here .... there's great pasta at That's Pasta in Muri and Ambalas Cafe has good organic food on Friday and Saturday. Even better, buy some freshly caught Yellow-fin Tuna from a local fisherman for NZ 2 (about 70p) and grill it with some olive oil and lime juice. Cyber.net.ck is the best web access, it's next door to Ronnies Bar in Avarua. Some of the best snorkelling is on the reef side of Taakoka Island in Muri Lagoon, and in the lagoon across the road from Fruits of Rarotonga in Titikaveka.</P>
