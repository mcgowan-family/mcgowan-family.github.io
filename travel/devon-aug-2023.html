</DIV>

<P>Having taken ownership of the kayak last year, we were keen to spend more time by the sea. We managed to find two cottages right by the south coast of Devon and would spend a week at each of them. the first was in Hooe Lake on the southern outskirts of Devon and the second was back in Lympstone, on the Exe Estuary, where we had enjoyed a lovely holiday in the Spring of 2022.</P>

<p>Our first cottage on Hooe Lake was right on the water with <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-1.jpeg">lovely views</a> out towards the Cattewater. Even better, it had its own jetty!!! So the first task was to get the boat inflated and get out on the water. <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-2.jpeg">Moss was the first shipmate</a> and he did very well.</p>

<p>Plymouth was a really lovely spot. We took the boat over to the Barbican and, the next day, spent a lovely few hours in <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-3.jpeg">the Tinside Lido</a>. See if you can spot the family! I reckon this is my new favourite lido.</p>

<p>We spent a lovely afternoon at the <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-5.jpeg">Royal William Yard</a> in Plymouth. The kids mucked about <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-4.jpeg">on the sea walls</a>, explored <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-6.jpeg"></a>old tunnelsthe  and then we had a lovely meal overlooking <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-7.jpeg">the marina</a> at the Yard.</p>

<p>We had a choice of lovely beaches near Hooe Lake. We visited Jenny Hill, Wembury and <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-8.jpeg">this is Mothecombe</a>.</p>

 
<p>We had some good trips in the boat at Mothecombe, but this is us back on Hooe Lake. Bryher is always a wee bit worried about getting in the boat, but <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-9.jpeg"></a>she coped admirably.</p>

<p>On a very wet day, we visited the excellent <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-10.jpeg">Box Museum</a> in Plymouth. I think Patrick is just <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-11.jpeg">reaching a conclusion</a> on the deeper meaning within this particular installation. We headed across the Tamar just to say we had been in Cornwall, but it did afford us a great view of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's bridge. It is known as <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-12.jpeg">the Royal Albert bridge</a> and was cpompleed  in 1859 the same year as his death, which led them to add his name above the portals to the main span.</p>

<p>So that was the end of our first week in Devon and, after some <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-13.jpeg">last minute photo opportunities</a>, we headed off to Lympstone.</p>

<p>Being on the estuary, Lympstone is a very different place, but one we knew well. Much of the week was spent exploring the beach, with its lovely old red <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-14.jpeg">Devonian Sandstone backdrop</a>. But we also popped up to Crealy Theme Park at Exeter for <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-15.jpeg">a change of scenery</a>.</p>

    
<p>Exmouth is a nice little beach venue, especially the <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-16.jpeg">east end of the promenade</a>. This ice cream really is <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-17.jpeg">as big as it looks</a>. There is always <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-18.jpeg">>something to see</a> on the beach.</p>
    
    
<p>Towards the end of the week, me and Patrick did a lovely <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-19.jpeg">crossing of the estuary</a>crossing of the estuary in the boat.  It was the highest tide of the year and <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-20.jpeg">the Compass Rose</a> was sat in the little creek where the Wotton Brook empties into the estuary. It was the most beautiful crossing and a really nice shared moment with Patrick. A Peregrine flew over us on teh way out, we say a Kinfisher over at the Starcross yacht Club and a lovely Sandwich Tern drifted over our hreads on the way back. <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-21.jpeg">Beautiful</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>And she trys to pretend <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-22.jpeg">she doesn't like dogs</a> :) This was our last day when we headed up to museum and checked out the museum there, which happened to have a <a href="../images/Devon%252023/devon-23-23.jpeg">medieval combat re-enactment</a> session on.</p>
