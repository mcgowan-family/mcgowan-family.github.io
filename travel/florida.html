<P>December cracked off with the trip over to Florida to compete in Challenger Worlds 2005. We had all been taking the training <A HREF="../images/Challenger/steve-tapering.jpg">pretty seriously</A>, so it was good to have a few days before the event to see a bit of Florida and relax.</P>

<P>We picked up the most <A HREF="../images/Challenger/jb-living-large.jpg">sensible cars</A> we could find and headed down to <A HREF="../images/Challenger/soft-top.jpg">Miami</A>.</P>


<P>After a couple of days on the Keys, we nippped round to the Everglades and cought up on the <A HREF="../images/Challenger/team-gator.jpg">wildlife</A>. We even got some <A HREF="../images/Challenger/bikes-abreast.jpg">biking</A> training in.</P>

<P>We dropped in on Everglades City and took a <A HREF="../images/Challenger/glades-city.jpg">small boat</A> out through the mangroves and into the Gulf. The weather was a bit iffy, but it was very cool and Hurricane Wilma had tossed up some great shells on the tiny keys scattered across the Gulf.</P>

<P>We dropped in on John and Ann Silcock on the way up to Crystal River and, after the mandatory run in with <A HREF="../images/Challenger/andy-nicked.jpg">the law</A>, it was time to<A HREF="../images/Challenger/worlds-05.jpg"> don the gear</A> and start the competition.</P>

<P>There were only 5 stages over 3 days, so the endurance aspects were much less serious than UK Challenger. The quality of the competition had gone up as expected. Stage 1 was a timed-gate orienteering stage through forest land and<A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage1-05.jpg"> the guys</A> did a great job keeping us in contention (I sat this one out). <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage2-05-start.jpg">Stage 2</A> was an engineering stage and for once <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage2-05-bales.jpg">we did pretty well</A>. Stage 3 was a night stage with orienteering and logic problems, Again we did well to leave ourselves in second place with more than half the contest behind us.</P>

<P>Day 2 turned out far less well. The penultimate stage had harsh penalties for not coming in the first few teams. Despite <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage4-05.jpg">a big physical effort,</A> we finished well out of the places. This put us out of the contest and the last stage was something of a blur. It was a sad end to a great year in Challenger, but such is the nature of contests. A better team won on the day.</P>

<P>The contest closed with a party on the Saturday night. For some, the exertions had clearly been <A HREF="../images/Challenger/party-05.jpg">too much</A> ;o)</P>

<P>We decided to do something on the Sunday morning to take our minds off the result, so we rented a couple of canoes and went in search of the fabled Crystal River manatees. It was a brilliant outing and I ended up swimming through a mangrove channel into the Three Sisters Spring and having a manatee 'browse' on my hand and arm. Amazing. They also took a liking to <A HREF="../images/Challenger/manatee-2.jpg">our canoes</A> and seemed to enjoy pushing them into the bank :o)</P>
