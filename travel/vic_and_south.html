<P>We arrived in Oz on 3 March</P>

<P>Melbourne is a wonderfully liveable city. It has the 'village districts in a big city' feel that New York has. Wander down to <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/victoria_market_1.jpg">Victoria Market</A> and order up <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/victoria_market_2.jpg">something for the BBQ</A>.</P>

<P>Check out the Yarra River; there seems to be <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/yarra.jpg">something going on</A> all the time. Lin finally caved and tried out <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/lin_jumps.jpg">something more extreme</A> than quilting.</P>

<P>Take the number 16 tram down to St.Kilda, go for a walk on the pier then splurge on cakes and coffee on <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/acland_street.jpg">Acland Street</A>.</P>

<P>There are little lanes and <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/blocks.jpg">arcades</A> all over with bars, cafes and all sorts of little stores.</P>

<P>In Melbourne, as everywhere else we've been, there was universal opposition to war in Iraq. <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/demo.jpg">This particular demo</A> found 25 000 school kids in front of the state library.</P>

<P>We happened to be in town while the F1 Grand Prix was revving up. I was astonished to find that <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/grand_prix.jpg">Schumacher's car</A> has no ability to attach a bike rack. All that money and no hitch, what's that about?</P>

<P>We were staying up in Carlton in Melbourne. Food is fantastic! Try the University Cafe (no, not that one) on Lygon or the wonderful Abla Lebanese on Elgin.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/surfs_up.jpg">Surfs up</A> and I may finally be getting the hang of it. We can recommend the Erskine Falls Cottages back up in the bush above Lorne for accommodation and excellent food cooked by Jamie the chef. You get some <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/cockatoo.jpg">wild stuff</A> on the bird-table on the deck.</P>

<P>We went for a bush walk and found a bunch of koala, rock wallabies and the star attraction of a <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/echidna.jpg">Short-Beaked Echidna</A>.</P>


<P>The Great Ocean Road is a wonderful drive with long swinging bends and fantastic scenery dropping off the side. The <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/otway_light.jpg">Otway Light</A> is Australia's most southerly point and the <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/twelve_apostles.jpg">Twelve Apostles</A> is a must see along this stretch.</P>


<P>So much sight-seeing is thirsty work, so we cut inland to sample the delights of the <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/wynns.jpg">Coonawarra</A> and <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/barossa.jpg">Barossa</A> regions. A bottle from the cellar for anyone who can name the vineyard Lin is standing in (the clue is the building behind her).</P>

<P>You've drunk it by the gallon, you've woken up and found that you poured half a bottle of it on that nice white carpet again, now have your picture taken next to the actual sign over the actual patch of scuzzy green water <A HREF="../images/South_and_Victoria/jacobs_creek.jpg">where it all began</A>.</P>

<P>Stop press!! Coulthard wins Melbourne Grand Prix to re-establish Scotland as one of the world's great sporting nations. I have been forbidden to mention the rugby match - so I won't.</P>
