<P>For many years I'd been wanting to climb a sea stack in the far north-west of Scotland known as <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/oldman1.jpg">the Old Man of Stoer</A>. I had first seen it back in the early 80's  on a trip with Fitz, Fike, Bruno and co. It had remained consistent in my memory as an iconic piece of rock and I really wanted to go climb it :o)</P>

<P>So that was the seed of the idea, and we hung a number of other pieces around that kernel - a sea kayak navigation around the Summer Isles, overnighting on one of the uninhabited islands; big classic rock climbs in the mountains of Applecross; kayaking in Loch Leven and off Applecross, camping and hostelling in the best bits of the  north-west highlands; great little beaches at Achmelvich and who knows, maybe even an otter ;o)</P>

<P>Our team would be 7 strong: <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/steve-rose.jpg">Steve and Rose</A>, <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/leo-raph.jpg">Raph and Leo</A>, <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/toby-mikey.jpg">Mikey and Toby</A> and <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/gearing-up.jpg">me</A>.</P>

<P>We travelled up to Glen Coe on the first day (stopping off to buy loads of gear from <A HREF="../images/Skiing/shell-edges.jpg">Michelle</A> in Ellis Brighams) and stayed in the hostel, spending the evening in the ever excellent Clachaig. We'd <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/carlisle-canoes.jpg">picked up the kayaks</A> at Carlisle Canoes (great little store to be recommended) and we decided to get our sea kayaking feet wet in the relatively <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/leven-kayaks.jpg">calm waters of Loch Leven</A>. It turned out to be a great intro, with some fun exploring on the islands that host the burial ground of Clan Donald of GlenCoe. Someone thought they heard an otter ....</P>


<P>All that paddling worked up an appetite, but nothing prepares you for a <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/mikey-mauls1.jpg">Mikey on the food scavenge</A>. That poor chicken didn't know what hit it. This was to become a theme of the trip.</P>

<P>After getting the boats out and on the roof, we headed north through Fort William (coffee and cake in NevisSport of course) and on up to Applecross. </P>

<P>Applecross is one of those magical places that is so remote and wild it feels like you've crossed into a whole other place. Another climb I'd wanted to do for years was <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/sword-of-gideon.jpg">the Sword of Gideon</A>. Just liked the name really. Nice rock and a nice climb.</P>

<P>The campsite down near the beach is great, as is the little restaurant. The Volvo was quickly turning into a nice little <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/team-bus.jpg">expedition bus</A>. While we were on the climb, Steve and Rose had a paddle up and down the coast. Very nice too and allegedly, some signs of otter .....</P>

<P>Next morning we all got up to different stuff. <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/leo-raph.jpg">Raph and Leo </A>went back and did Sword of Gideon. The good news is, it was still there. Me, Mikey and Toby headed across the moors and on up <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/toby-mikey.jpg">the Cioch</A>. What a fantastic climb!!! It rained towards the top which added to the whole exposed feel of the place and we all got up and off safe. Good effort all round.</P>

<P>Rose and Steve went and did more paddling in the Gairloch. They'd be growing fins soon.</P>

<P>Next stop was <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/achiltibuie.jpg">Achiltibuie</A>. Fantastic Youth Hostel at Achinver. Will go back there soon, if only to enjoy the warmth of the hostel warden's welcome. Just makes me feel good thinking about that kind of hospitality.</P>

<P>The weather was very wet as we went to bed. So imagine our delight when the next day turned out to be a flat calm, with sun and fluffy wee clouds. Just right for our paddle out and around the otherwise exposed southern approaches to the Summer Isles. Some  notes in the hostel visitors book about otters nearby ...</P>

<P>It couldn't have been <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles1.jpg">a better day</A> and we all felt comfortable and happy as we <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles2.jpg">rafted up</A> before setting off on <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles3.jpg">the crossing to Tanera Mor</A>. We slid  through <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles4.jpg">the flat waters</A> to the natural arch at the southern end of Tanera Beg. I mean - what could possibly go wrong? <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles5.jpg">Oops</A>.</P>

<P>Once we had the boat <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles6.jpg">the right way up</A> again, we made landing on Tanera Beg, where we found <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles8.jpg">a magical campsite</A> with views across all of Assynt. As the sun went down, the hills were lit by <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summer-isles7.jpg">an eerie light</A> and we got the fire going. We spent a truly happy night on Tabera Beg. <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/campfire.jpg">Big fire</A>, loads of port and whisky, great food and fabulous company. More <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/mikey-mauls2.jpg">theme eating</A> from Mikey. A quick shower hastened us to bed after midnight and brought in the winds that were to be the feature of the next day.</P>

<P>We headed off next day in a brisk force 4 from the south. However, we had planned for this (no, really!) and were able to stay in the lee of the archipelago as we headed back east towards the mainland.</P>

<P>We stopped in at a sheltered beach for some lunch before making the long haul back across the sound. At that point we were all treated to a fantastic sight as an otter popped it's head out of the surf and proceeded to catch fish, float on its back, flip its tail around and generally pose as much as any otter could. Unfortunately, somebody moved and scared it off - think it was Rose!!! Typical.</P>

<P>Next day found us all in Achmelvich Youth Hostel. We were down to 2 cars, as Raphs had packed in. Mike got to sample more warm highland hospitality in the Lochinver Pie Shop. Guess they were just trying to make a Yorkshireman feel at home. Can't explain this picture, might be <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/lochinver.jpg">another otter joke</A>.</P>

<P>We set off the next day to climb <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/oldman1.jpg">the Old Man</A>. We set up <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/raph-tyrols.jpg">the Tyrollean</A>, thanks mainly to sterling efforts from <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/leo-swims.jpg">Leo in the water</A> and Raph on the ropes. We made the first pitch, but the weather closed in and abandoning the climb was the only option. We left the ropes up to make things quicker tomorrow. It was the last day of the trip, so we needed good weather to have any chance of getting up the climb.</P>

<P>The next day dawned bright and sunny. We shot back to the Stoer peninsula and nipped across the traverse for the second time. The sea was <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/MOV01460.MPG">still pretty wild</A>, so it was time to get on with it. We quickly <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/roping-up.jpg">sorted ropes</A> and I applied more chalk than Dover can muster on the greasy traverse. Steve made a neater job by jamming it. We decided to split the first pitch in two to make the rope work easier. <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/gearing-up.jpg">Second pitch</A> was gorgeous, sunny rock, positive holds, bring it on. The climb steepens from this point and <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/pitch3.jpg">moves up right</A> on thin gear. A big belay ledge leads on to the penultimate pitch which runs easily out and right onto <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/leo-belay4.jpg">the landward face</A> of the Stac, the last pitch (if you find it!) goes <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/steve-climbing.jpg">straight up a chimney</A> to <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/steves-up.jpg">the summit</A> and an airy and <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/summit.jpg">relieved finish</A> on what must rank as one of my best climbs. Many thanks to those that made it possible :o) </P>

<P>While we'd been on the Old Man, Rose, Toby and Mikey had gone to the <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/falls-of-kirkaig.jpg">Falls of Kirkaig</A>. We all met up at <A HREF="../images/Assynt-06/achmelvich.jpg">Achmelvich</A> and shared our stories, before heading of down the road to Glasgow.</P>

<P>What a great trip!</P>
