</DIV>

<P>We had been promising the kids for years that we would go to Legoland. We finally bit the bullet just before half term in the Autumn of 2015 and it was great timing. It was an inset day for Leckhapmpton school, and towards the end of their season, so the place was pretty quiet.</P>

<p>We made out we were just going for a drive to a local park, so they were <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-1-oct-15.jpg">properly amazed</a> when we pulled into Legoland. Why they thought it was taking us 2 hours to drive to a local park is another matter.</p>

<p>I have to say we were <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-2-oct-15.jpg">really impressed</a> by Legoland. Not just because of <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-3-oct-15.jpg">the Chamonix link</a> :) Sarah thought it was <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-4-oct-15.jpg">very cool</a> too.</p>


<p>The kids <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-5-oct-15.jpg">went nuts </a>for the whole day. And we got to go on <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-6-oct-15.jpg">most of the rides</a> we wanted. This is me and Bryher on <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-7-oct-15.jpg">the Dino Safari</a>!</p>

<p>Patrick was big enough to go on <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-8-oct-15.jpg">most rides on his own</a> - if he stood on tip toes! But I went on the <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-9-oct-15.jpg">Pirate Falls </a>ride too as it looked like great fun. The biggest thrill was <a href="../images/Legoland-15/legoland-10-oct-15.jpg">The Dragon</a>!</p>


<p>It was a long day and a great day and by the time we were winding our way back out through Ascot, we realised we weren't going to make it home for dinner, so we stopped in to McDonalds in Reading for a quick supper. The kids thought this was all just part of the best day ever!!! </p>
