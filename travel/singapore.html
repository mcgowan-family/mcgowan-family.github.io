<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Singapore 2003</H1>
</DIV>

<P>We arrived in Singapore on 27 March, 2003</P>

<P>Like Sydney, picking up accommodation at the airport is simple and pretty reasonable. Having walked around the city, the <I>Perak Lodge</I> in Little India and the <I>Inn on Temple Street</I> in Chinatown both looked good if you prefer character to international bland.</P>

<P>Having watched <I>Adaptation</I> (another good movie) we had an unlikely interest in orchids. It so happens that Singapore has the world's greatest collection at its <A HREF="../images/Singapore/orchids.jpg">Botanic Gardens</A>, so we checked them out.</P>

<P>There are plenty of great places to eat in Singapore. You can go to the nicely restored <A HREF="../images/Singapore/chijmes.jpg">Chijmes</A> (used to be a Catholic mission school) which has a whole bunch of restaurants, or head along to one of the local places like <A HREF="../images/Singapore/lau_pa_sat.jpg">Lau Pa Sat</A> market for <A HREF="../images/Singapore/satay.jpg">satay</A>.</P>


<P>You may choose to have a swift one before dining, in which case I can recommend the New Asia bar at the top of the <A HREF="../images/Singapore/stamford_hotel.jpg">Stamford Hotel</A>. Get there in time to see the city in daylight, then just watch the <A HREF="../images/Singapore/stamford_view.jpg">lights of the city</A> come on while you wait. It's a tourist 'must see', but <A HREF="../images/Singapore/raffles_hotel.jpg">Raffles</A> is also a very nice hotel and they're relaxed about you just wandering round before retiring to the Long Bar for a Gin Sling.</P>

<P>A wide range of cultures mingle in Singapore and one of the best places to see this is in <A HREF="../images/Singapore/little_india.jpg">Little India</A>. Wandering round the streets and <A HREF="../images/Singapore/tekka_market.jpg">markets</A> for a couple of hours you come across amazing <A HREF="../images/Singapore/mosque.jpg">mosques</A>, wonderful <A HREF="../images/Singapore/hindi_temple.jpg">Hindi temples</A> and the festival of <A HREF="../images/Singapore/ching_may.jpg">Ching Ming</A> (festival for the dead) being celebrated by burning fake bank notes and other offerings. The locals were all very welcoming and happy to explain what was going on.</P>


<P>Little India is a lot less Disneyfied than Chinatown, but even there if you get off the beaten track there's <A HREF="../images/Singapore/taoist_temple.jpg">plenty to see</A>.</P>

<P>There's an easy walk (it needs to be in that humidity) that you can do around the colonial district. Check out the <A HREF="../images/Singapore/raffles.jpg">Raffles statue</A>, the <A HREF="../images/Singapore/merlion.jpg">Merlion</A> and the techy-looking <A HREF="../images/Singapore/esplanade_halls.jpg">concert hall</A>.</P>

<P>The stay ended with SARS breaking out across South East Asia, England won the Hong Kong 7s and then the Grand Slam; surely the end of the world is nigh. But lo, Scotland top their group for Euro 96, so life goes on.</P>

<P>Joke of the week comes with thanx to Yan.</P>

<P>"You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy,
the best golfer is a black guy, France is accusing the US of arrogance
and Germany doesn't want to go to war."</P>
