<P>James H sugggested a trip to Morocco in Nov and we managed to find one with Rough Tracks. It was a group of 9 travellers, 1 tour guide and 3 local guides. The week was spent in the hills and deserts around Ouarzazate. There was much "riding through the desert with undulations" and a great time was had by all.</P>

<P>The food and driving were done by Brahim, Hamed and Lassan. <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/stuart.jpg">Stuart Williams</A> was the bike guide. Accommodation was a mix of hotels, tents and one amazing night spent in a 'gite'.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/day1.jpg">The scenery </A>was amazing throughout, with mountains and gorges all around. I wasn't aware of just how fantastic the whole north African experience would be in Morocco, with fabulous <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/kasbah.jpg">desert architecture</A> all around, and some of the <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/jalabah_shades.jpg">friendliest folk</A> I've ever come across. 
</P>

<P>The town markets were filled with every variety of spice, cunningly re-used <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/amphorae.jpg">car tyres</A>, carefully dismembered livestock (picture omitted) and more carpets than you could ever want to haggle over.
</P>

<P>We biked through the <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/dades.jpg">gorges</A>, over the <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/high_pass.jpg">passes</A>, into the <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/ross_snow.jpg">snow</A> and <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/bikers.jpg">out again</A>. At the end of a long ride, it's amazing how much fun you can have with a hose and a liberal attitude. Once again, no pictures survive, so you'lll just need to use your imaginations.</P>

<P>In a short time, we shared a lot of stuff in the group. We shared <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/gite_party.jpg">a birthday party</A>, we shared <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/snow_fight.jpg">a snow fight</A>, Lassan shared <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/lassan_and_wives.jpg">his wives</A>, we shared some <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/team_lunch.jpg">great meals</A>, we even built a stonking <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/snowman.jpg">snow man</A> and we'll continue to share some great memories of <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/monkeys_fingers.jpg">a trip in the mountains with bikes</A>.</P>

<P>We all felt sad to leave such an amazing place after such a short time, and as <A HREF="../images/Moroccco_2004/sunrise.jpg">the sun rose</A> over the Atlas for the last time there was a real wish to make it last just a little bit longer. </P>


<P>We did manage to eek it out a bit, by escaping from Casablanca International into the old town. We wandered round the <I>medina</I> and managed to get a scrub down and massage at the <I>hammam</I>. The massage was more like all in wrestling with Gandhi. Fortunately, cultural sensitivities prevent me from bringing you any images, but if you ever get the chance go for it, but don't forget your towel!
