<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Mousehole, July 2022</H1>
</DIV>

<P>We decided to take advantage of the sneaky two weeks at thet start of the kids summer holiday and booked a great little cottage right <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-01.jpeg">in the heart of Mousehole</a>.We happened to pick the fortnight that had Britain's warmest heatwave on record. Fortunately it was a little cooler on the coast and we got to spend every day in the sea, but also racked up some pretty impressive sunburn and mild heatstroke!</P>

<p>On the first day, we found a fantastic little sea-fed rock pool that had been fashioned into <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-02.jpeg">a natural swimming pool</a>.We spent <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-03.jpeg">many happy days</a> here, but sadly on the frist of those, I had a freak accident that seemed relatively minor, but unhappily broke my sternum - ouch! Six months later, it still hadn't healed properly. The rock pool and the sea around it were full of life - <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-07.jpeg">all of it wild</a>!</p>

<p>I was keen that we were able to get out on the water, so after loking at various options, I plumped for <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-04.jpeg">an inflatable kayak</a>. There's a little island just off the harbour, and if you <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-24.jpeg">paddle round the other side</a> you've got a good chance of coming across Atlantic Grey Seals. Bryher wasn't too keen on being in teh water with big scary mammals.</p>

<p>Many years ago I had rowed past the Mynack Theatre as we prepared for the Trans Atlantic row. We <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-05.jpeg">finally got to go there</a> and see a great little show all about Pip, the Particularly Pesky Piskie! Later that same day, we took in a trip to <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-06.jpeg">Lands End</a>.</p>

<p>Public transport <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-12.jpeg">by bus in Cornwall</a> is a great option. MAny days took a similar pattern of geting up and catching the bus into <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-08.jpeg">Penzance</a>, then shooting off to somewhere else <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-18.jpeg">like Porthcurno</a>, with the excellent PK museum of telecommunications.</p>

 
<p>It turns out we weren't the only ones spending their summer holidays in Cornwall. No one knew at this point, but <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-13.jpeg">the man who would shortly be King</a> was also there, along with <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-14.jpeg">the future Queen and a little Prince</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever we are in Cornwall I always want to go back to the Scillies. Everyoe bravely agreed to get on the boat for a day trip, but could we actually make it all the way to Bryher! It was a tough ask, made tougher by the tides which meant that the Firethorn couldn't get to Bryher. So there was nothing for it but <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-09.jpeg">to walk there</a> through the tidal race. But it looks like <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-10.jpeg">it was worth it</a> :)</p>

<p>We went to St.Michael's Mount, another one I'd always wanted to get to. Sadly we couln't get on the island that day, but it was <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-11.jpeg">another lovely day on the beach</a>. It was a nice split between seeing lovely bits of Cornwall and just <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-15.jpeg">mucking about in Mousehole</a>. And no, <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-16.jpeg">you can't have any money for that telescope</a>.</p>

<p>As well as the bus, <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-19.jpeg">you can walk</a> to a lot of lovely spots from Mousehole. We spent a lovely day walking over to <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-22.jpeg">Lamorna Cove</a>. We didn't see anyone else on the walk, but there were <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-20.jpeg">plenty of locals</a>. And there's <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-21.jpeg">a lot of history </a>around those parts. Looks like everyone <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-23.jpeg">took it in their stride.</a></p>

    
<p>I hope we go back to Mousehole. <a href="../images/Mousehole%2022/mousehole-17.jpeg">It was a lovely spot</a> :)</p>
