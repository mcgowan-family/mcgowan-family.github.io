</DIV>

<p>I had the opportunity to travel to Israel and it was a memorable visit. I had wanted to see the Old City for many years, recalling my Dad's storis of being poste there during the Mandate.</p>

<p>I took the train from Tel Aviv and got off at the Central Station. From there I took the light rail down to the Old City and entered via the Jaffa Gate.</p>
    
<p>Entering the Old City transports you back a 1000 years or more in some cases. I wandered <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-01.jpeg">through the Christian Quarter</a>.Some areas were <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-02.jpeg">busy with shops</a>, but there were plenty of <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-03.jpeg">secretive alleyways lined with gardens</a>. We came upon the <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-04.jpeg">Church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>. I began to have a strong sense of walking in my Dad's footsteps. He had been in exactly this place, in the late forties, after being shipped to Palestine following the end of WWII. It was really moving to walk through the church, <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-05.jpeg">amazing in its own right</a>, but with the added sense of the link back to him, 75 years earlier. <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-06.jpeg">This incredible icon</a> is said to mark the rock where Christ was crucified.</p>

<p>I walked through the Muslim quarter, just as the afternoon call to prayer rang out.the alleyways emptied completely. Where moments before there had been hundreds of people, suddenly we were alone and feeling quite conspicuous.</p>

<p>From the Muslim Quarter into the Jewish Quarter and <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-08.jpeg">the plaza of the Western Wall</a>, also known as the Wailing Wall. I had wanted to get to <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-09.jpeg">the Dome of the Rock</a> and al Aqsa Mosque, but it wasn't going to be possible this day. So I just enjoyed the long views</a>.</p>

 
<p>As I passed out of the Jewish Quarter, I stopped in <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-07.jpeg">this amazing little store</a> and watched a scene play out between the ageing store owner and his equally ancient customer. Again, you had the sense that this had played out here for ages past. The Old City, scene of so much turmoil, strangely calm and every day, in its domestic interactions.</p>
    
<p>And then out of the Jewish Quarter and into the Armenian. <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-11.jpeg">This has to be my favourite street sign, representing so much history and the cultural melting pot, all in one little street sign.</a>.</p>
        

<p>I took the light rail back towards Central Station, but decided to jump off at the Machaneh Jehudah. Someone had mentioned to me this was a lively place to see and <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-13.jpeg">it certainly was</a>! This was the most authentic place we spent time, from the great beer at the Beer Bazaar, to <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-14.jpeg">the crowded halls of the souk</a>.</p>
    

<p>This had been a brief but very memorable visit to Israel</a>. <a href="../images/Jerusalem-May-22/jerusalem-15.jpeg">A country of conflict</a> and hardship, but a place of great beauty and history as well.</p>
