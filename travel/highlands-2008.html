<P>The plan was to take 10 days or so and travel up and down the West Coast. No fixed plan, but a few key spots to see. We set off from Glasgow in glorious sunshine (as God is my judge) and headed up past Loch Lomond to <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/inveraray.jpg">Inveraray</A>. We had just missed Joey playing in the Ladies Scottish Open. Maybe next year :o( Stayed in cool B&B at Cluanieraigh. Unfortunately left half our belongings in cupboard when we drove off next morning, but the nice lady posted them back to Glasgow for us :o)</P>

<P>Headed up via Lochgilphead, <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/castle stalker.jpg">Loch Creran</A>, Oban, Fort Bill to Arisaig. Or as Sarah kept calling it, Arseaid. Not sure about that one. Another great B&B with a great old shepherd and his lovely wife Elsbeth.</P>

<P>We spent the morning on the <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/footsteps.jpg">white sands</A> of Morar. Sar got her first taste of a great <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/morar.jpg">west coast sunset</A> later that day.</P>

<P>We just managed to catch the ferry to Armadale on Skye and made our way up through <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/storr.jpg">Storr</A>, past <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/kilt.jpg">Kilt Rock</A> and over the Quirang to Uig. Another nice B&B, but by now we'd worked out that B&B's and babys don't go that well together. Especially when all 3 of us were coming down with heavy colds. The good news was that I'd picked up a reel in Fort Bill to go with the rod I'd nicked from Gerry. So Sarah was <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/gone fishing.jpg">VERY happy</A> about that. And to pass the time before the ferry, we went round to Staffin and chucked the line <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/gone fishing too.jpg">in there too</A>.</P>

<P>Before heading over to the Uists, we booked a nice self catering place with a nice wee man called Angus John Nicholson; known far and wide, throughout the reaches of the southern half of North Uist. The character out in the Heb's was quite different. Much more remote and ruggged with <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/balranald.jpg">amazing beaches</A> strung down the west coast.</P>

<P>We spent 3 days on the Uists and Berneray, but never saw an otter. I had a strong sense of <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/otters.jpg">being watched constantly</A> though .....</P>

<P>When it was time to go we took the ferry from Berneray across to Leverburgh on Harris. The weather was still amazing. Blue skies and warm winds. I had never seen Harris in anything other than driving water and cloud. And while that has its own special charm, driving up the west coast from Northton, through the beaches at <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/buirgh.jpg">Buirgh</A> and <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/hargabost.jpg">Hargabost</A> was breathtaking. After <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/roadtrip.jpg">stopping for lunch</A>, we pushed on through Lewis and made our way back to the west coast as the light was starting to mellow into evening.</P>

<P>Which was the perfect time to check out <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/callanish1.jpg">Callanish</A>. Second only to Stonehenge, <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/callanish2.jpg">these stones</A> go back 5000 years. <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/callanish3.jpg">Great setting</A> for <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/callanish4.jpg">a woman on the edge</A>.</P>

<P>A little further up the coast, you pass by <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/carloway.jpg">the broch at Carloway</A>. There's a bizarre story about this <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/whalebones.jpg">grizzly memento</A>. The huge whale was washed up on the beach, but when the blacksmith went to pull the harpoon from its side, it finally went off, seriously wounding him. A little further on, is the evocative <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/blackhouse.jpg">blackhouse at Arnol</A>. Lived in till 1966 and one of the last of the type that nearly everyone on Lewis had lived in well into the 20th century.</P>

<P>Just to prove that the sun really was shining in Lewis, Patrick <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/shady.jpg">got his shades on</A> in Stornoway. As it was a Sunday, this was seen as slightly frivolous by the locals.</P>

<P>We left the Western Isles and headed back across to Ullapool. Next day found us at Achmelvich; always a great place and <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/achmelvich1.jpg">the sun has normally shone</A> on me there. We found this <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/achmelvich2.jpg">great little bothy</A> to stay in on the grounds of Ingrid Ritchie's croft. More fishing was called for, but with the news reaching us that in the past 20 years we had wiped out 30% of the planets wildlife, we decided to do our part, and so <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/achmelvich3.jpg">we caught nothing</A> for a long time. The bothy wasn't much bigger than the car, but had a great atmosphere inside. <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/achmelvich4.jpg">Patrick got cosy</A> and <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/achmelvich5.jpg">Sarah settled down</A> for the evening.</P>

<P>Next morning found the sun lighting up the cabin. Patrick celebrated by face diving into a bowl of creamed rice. <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/achmelvich6.jpg">He was well pleased</A> with his efforts.</P>

<P>Our last stop was the new trails that have been laid through the Little Assynt estate. <A HREF="../images/Highlands08/cuineag.jpg">Cuineag</A> makes a dramatic backdrop </P>
