<P>Another state, another traffic violation :o)</P>

<P>Spent a couple of weeks in California with Fitz in Sep. Things got off to rocky start. Spent night out in Baltimore with Neal & Kate, followed by horrible hangover and complete absence of valid tickets for flights to California. I ended up buying a new set of flights to get me back on track. Met up with Fitz and his pal Paul Westwater (a footballl playing, house painting member of a number of SF bands from Fort Bill) on arrival. We headed into SF, met up with Paul's girlfriend Eunice and went for a fantastic Italian at Gaspare's on Geary. Paul and Eunice live in what is called <A HREF="../images/USA/outer-richmond.jpg">the Outer Richmond</A>. It's a great part of San Fran, just south of the GG Bridge and right next to the GG Park.</P> 

<P>After getting over the night before, the road trip started heading east over the <A HREF="../images/USA/bay-bridge.jpg">Bay Bridge</A> towards the High Sierras. We went directly to Yosemite and tried to get a spot in the legendary Camp 4 walk-in. Took a while getting familliar with all the bear preccautions. Not all the food seems to end up <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/pies.jpg">in the lockers</A>! We spent the next day hiking on <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/sentinel.jpg">the south rim</A> of the valley.</P>

<P>As ever, Yosemite lived up to expectations and Paul was suitably impressed. We combined the 4 Mile Trail, <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/half-dome-and-falls.jpg">Panorama Trail</A> and Nevada & <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/vernal.jpg">Vernal Falls</A> Trails to make a big first day. Second day in the valley was spent <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/oak-tree-flake.jpg">climbing on the local wall</A> to Camp 4 (Swan Slabs). It's tiny by Yosemite standards, but hey, it was still Yosemite :o) </P>

<P>We took a great trip round to Tuolumne Meadows on the tour bus. The driver - Charles - was a riot. Definitely worth doing. We hiked from Tenaya Lake to Sunrise Creek via the summmit of Clouds Rest (roughly 9 500 feet). The <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/half-dome.jpg">view of Half Dome</A> and the Valley from Clouds Rest is awesome. We summitted on <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/half-dome-summit.jpg">Half Dome</A> that evening which gave a real sense of achievement. The views of <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/clouds-rest.jpg">Clouds Rest</A> and <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/merced.jpg">the Merced group</A> in the evening light were great. Back to camp, made a great fire and sat chatting to 3 girls from Washinton State all night before turning in. Next morning we headed back down to <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/el-cap.jpg">the valley</A> (early morning sun on <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/grub-grub.jpg">grub gnawed tree</A>), picked up the car and drove round to Bishop. Picked up a well travelled hitcher who'd been working on the trail building trails all summer. She gave us a top recommmendation for the coast - elephant seals! - which worked out well later in the trip.</P>

<P>It was good to get into a motel in Bishop and get clean again after 5 days of camping in Yosemite. We stayed at the excellent <A HREF="../images/USA/thunderbird.jpg">Thunderbird</A>, just off of Main. It's got everything you need round about it - great coffee breakfast place with WiFi, great dinner place (Whiskey Creek) and decent laundromat to wash all the manky gear. </P>


<P>We headed down to Lone Pine (the entry point for Mount Whitney) the next day. Things got a bit wild at this point. It transpires that there are only 10 permits a day for back country camping around Mount Whitney. 6 of those are raffled off 6 months before the date of entry (Feb in this case). The other 4 are allocated to walk-ins on the day. If more than 4 folk want to go in, then it goes to a lottery. It went to a lottery for us on the day, but the luck held and we got a pass :o) Lesson being, if you want to do Whiitney by anything other than the Normal Route - book ahead.</P>

<P>We were well acclimated for the attempt on Whitney. The weather forecast was good, so we were feeling pretty positive. All went to plan. We <A HREF="../images/Whitney/below-iceberg.jpg">ascended to Iceberg Lake</A>, via the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek. We crossed the infamous <A HREF="../images/Whitney/eckers-ledges.jpg">Ebersbachers Ledges</A> without incident. We had met a good few climbers in the hikers camp at Whitney Portal, and we made the ascent with 2 of them (<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/gibell.geo/trip_reports/WhitneyEastFace05.html">George and Warren</A> from Colorado).  One of the other pairs that had lost out on the lottery, attempted the East Buttress in a day from the Portal.  A massive effort that must have wrecked them, but they'd travelled down from Oregon, so they weren't going to miss out.</P>

<P>A girl had taken a fall on the Mountaineers Route that day. She fell at 11AM, gave herself a compound fracture of the ankle and it was 7PM before <A HREF="../images/Whitney/heli-rescue.jpg">the heli</A> finally managed to get close enough to lift her out. Must have been a horrible day.</P>

<P>The next morning was a glorious day. <A HREF="../images/Whitney/russell-iceberg.jpg">Mount Russell</A> was reflected in Iceberg, the <A HREF="../images/Whitney/whitney-first-light.jpg">summit of Whitney</A> was clear and the <A HREF="../images/Whitney/mountaineers-route.jpg">Mountaineer's Route</A> was clearly visible and pretty much clear of snow. We set off just after 8 and <A HREF="../images/Whitney/whitney-summit.jpg">summitted</A> around 10. The route is straightforward, with the best rock reserved for the final 50 feet if you keep left at the top of the summit gully. We had decided to go on to do Mount Muir. It turned out to be a great little climb. Really windy on top, with just enough room for <A HREF="../images/Whitney/muir.jpg">one at a time</A>.</P>

<P>That night we dropped down to a lower camp at 11 500 by Upper Boy Scout Lake. It was just as well, as the weather finally broke and the snow and rain came in with a vengeance. This meant that Mount Russell was now out of the question, but no bad thing as we were seriously in need of a wash. The big news on getting back was that the Hibees had gone down 1-0 to Celtic at Easter Road. The news unsettled Paul's mental state and led to some <A HREF="../images/USA/fitz-fashion.jpg">very unusual behaviour</A>. Just as well we were heading to San Francisco.</P>

<P>After the deprivations of the mountains, we decided to head round to the coast. We made our way up the Big Sur to San Francisco, checking out the <A HREF="../images/USA/elephant-seals.jpg">Elephant Seals</A> at Piedras Blancas, the Humpback Whales at Monterey (we saw a <A HREF="../images/USA/humpback-sealions.jpg">big male</A> and a <A HREF="../images/USA/humpback-mother-calf.jpg">mother with calf</A>) and stopping off at the many amazing beaches and headlands (<A HREF="../images/USA/julia-pfeiffer.jpg">Julia Pfeiffer</A>, <A HREF="../images/USA/bixby-beach.jpg">Bixby</A>, <A HREF="../images/USA/big-sur.jpg">Big Sur Point</A>)</P>

<P>Our last couple of days were spent <A HREF="../images/USA/san-fran-tram.jpg">around San Francisco</A> with Paul and Eunice. Paul took us down to Golden Gate park for <A HREF="../images/USA/gg-park-golf.jpg">a game of golf</A>; very funny and luckily no injuries. We went to some great resto's and bars around Outer Richmond (<I>Q</I> on Clement and <I>Trad'r Sam's</I> on Geary were worth a visit). Last day was spent over the GG Bridge on the Marin Headlands at <A HREF="../images/USA/muir-woods.jpg">Muir Woods</A> and the various beaches and parks (I'm definitely coming back as <A HREF="../images/USA/pier-39.jpg">a Sea Lion</A>).</P>
