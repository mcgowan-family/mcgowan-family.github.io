<P>Headed over to France with <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle6.jpg">Susan and Crispin</A> and down to the Alps near Bourg d'Oisans. Main purpose of the trip was to take part in <A HREF="../biking/etape-06.html">the Etape du Tour</A>.</P>

<P>We stayed in Allamont, which is about 70 km east of Grenoble and just round from Bourg d'Oisans. It's a great area, as your on the edge of the <A HREF="http://www.parcsnationaux.org/visites/flash.asp?b_langue=en">Parc National des Ecrins</A> with fabulous hiking, climbing, biking and paddling. There are  a few downhill resorts within a few miles (including Les Deux Alpes and Alpe d'Huez) and many of Le Tour's most famous climbs are in this region (or within a stupidly long ride of it!.</P>

<P>After we did the Etape, we went for a wander up an alp to stretch the legs out. There was loads of <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle2.jpg">wildlife</A> around. <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle4.jpg">Butterflies</A> were everywhere and the higher you climbed, the seasons rolled back and <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle3.jpg">alpine flowers</A> appeared. There were <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle5.jpg">fabulous views</A> in every direction.</P>

<P>Susan wasn't convinced she'd make the climb, so we were all very pleased when we reached the <A HREF="http://www.venosc.com/gb/ete/rando.htm">Refuge de Mozelle</A> and could settle in for a fabulous lunch. Pretty much anything is fabulous after a climb like that, but it really was quite good!</P>

<P>There was a local sheep herd in the area. Never seen so much Merino in one place!! And a bunch of very timid sheep dogs, but <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle7.jpg">one of them</A> just couldn't get enough attention. I think I've finaly got <A HREF="../images/Isere/mozelle8.jpg">all the slobber</A> out of the camera lens now.
</P>

<P>I reckon I might well be back in Bourg :o)</P>
