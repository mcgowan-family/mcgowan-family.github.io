<P>We took up a kind offer from Phil and Tina and popped over to Sardinia for a week during the October half term, staying at their wee flat in Olmeda, near to Alghero. Turned out to be a great time to go as the weather was kind, the beaches were empty, the sea was warm and all the restaurants were still open.</P>

<p>We got straight into it off the plane and hit the amazing beach of la Pelosa at Stintino. It was a long day, as we'd been on the move since 2 in the morning, but you couldn't complain with <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/stintino1.jpg">a view like that<a>. Sea life was fantastic as well and everyone got in the water with masks.

<p>The weather was due to be cloudy the next day, so we headed over to Neptune's Grotto at Capo Gaccia. Fabulous walk down the precarious stair case to <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/grotto1.jpg">the mouth of the cave</a>, then an exciting run across the wave washed entrance took us into <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/grotto2.jpg">the subterranean lake</a>. <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/grotto3.jpg">The kids loved it</a>, but everyone was a bit tired and needed carrying back up <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/grotto4.jpg">all those stairs!</a> The weather really broke as we got back to the top and we were treated to a classic Mediterranean thunderstorm. </p>

<p>The next day we headed down the coast to Bosa. It's a gorgeous little place, with a really undiscovered feel. Once more, the beach was empty and the water warm. <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/bosa.jpg">Life is good</a>.</p>

<p>Next day was all about Alghero. We walked through <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero1.jpg">the old streets</a>, with it's <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero2.jpg">Catalan feel</a>. Wandered round <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero3.jpg">the sea walls</a> that overlook <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero4.jpg">cat town</a> (complete with brilliant graffiti and <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero6.jpg">palm trees</a>). Sarah was spotting <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero5.jpg">little hearts</a> everywhere.</p>

<p>We stopped for <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero7.jpg">a friendly cup of coffee</a> and ice cream for the kids. Patrick decided to take <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero8.jpg">a few family snaps</a>.<a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero9.jpg"> Fabulous architecture</a> all around, then it was time for <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero10.jpg">a treat for lunch</a>, with Patrick making a good job of some <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero11.jpg">langoustines</a>.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon on the local Alghero beach of San Giovanni. They call it the Lido Beach.  Not as nice as those out in the country, but still <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero-beach1.jpg">great sea life</a>. We <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero-beach2.jpg">all got interested</a> in this one and <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero-beach3.jpg">Bryher was brave</a> enough to hold it. We were getting good at making <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero-beach4.jpg">fairy castles</a> and another <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/alghero-beach5.jpg">one of those hearts</a> popped up.</p>

<p>Too soon, it was our last day before flying home and we managed to find another fantastic little beach. It was along the coast road towards Capo Gaccia at Lazzaretto. A little crescent of sand with <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/lazzaretto3.jpg">a tower at one end</a>, backed by macchia and a friendly little beach bar that did snacks for us and the kids. Brilliant! <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/lazzaretto1.jpg">The water was clear and warm </a>and we spent the day <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/lazzaretto2.jpg">beach combing</a>,<a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/lazzaretto4.jpg"> watching the widlife</a> watching us, having <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/lazzaretto5.jpg">picnics in the tent</a> and <a href="../images/Sardinia%2012/lazzaretto6.jpg">finally and reluctantly</a> saying farewell to what had been a lovely few days in the sun with Patrick & Bryher. </p>

<p>Thanks again to Tina and Phil for the flat!</p>
