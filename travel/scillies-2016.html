<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Isles of Scilly, March, 2016</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Ever since we came up with the name of Bryher, we had been planning to return to the islands to introduce Bryher to Bryher. 2016 was the year.</P>

<p>Easter was early in 2016, so it was the last week of March, and the forecast for the crossing on the Scillonian looked nasty. But after a minimum of fuss, we were <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-1-mar-16.jpg">ready for the off</a>. We drove down to Penzance on the Friday evening, had supper in the wonderful <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-2-mar-16.jpg">Mackerel Sky</a> and stayed at the equally wonderful <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-3-mar-16.jpg">Trereife House</a>.</p>

<p>The crossing was as bad as forecast. The wind down at the dock in Penzance was severe and waves were breaking right across the huge sea wall and smashing into the upper decks of the Scillonian lying at anchor. We had to be rushed across the quay in the short gaps between the waves to avoid getting washed into the harbour! What we didn't know, but presumably the crew did, was that this was the leading edge of <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/uk-storm-centre/storm-katie">Storm Katie</a>. In retrospect, ytou have to wonder at the decision making process that allowed the captain to think this was something he was going ot head out into. It was, by a long way, the worst sea crossing I have ever endured. THe winds were well in excess of 70 mph. Over 100 mph was recorded at thet Needles. Everyone on board was sick adults, children, babies, dogs. The decks of the ship were awash in it. I didn't take any pictures! </p>


<p>This is <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-4-mar-16.jpg">how happy someone looks</a> when they get off the boat. It was great to be <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-5-mar-16.jpg">back in the Scillies</a>. Perhaps because it was early in the season it was really quiet, and we had <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-6-mar-16.jpg">the beaches</a> and <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-7-mar-16.jpg">paths</a> to ourselves.</p>


<p>Something we were definitely going to do, was get Bryher to Bryher. Our original plan had been to stay on Bryher, but problems with the accommodation meant we were staying on St.Mary's. As it happened, this was all for the best. Nonetheless, on the first fine day, we got <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-8-mar-16.jpg">back on the boats</a>. And this is what a <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-9-mar-16.jpg">Bryher on Bryher</a> looks like. It was a gorgeous day, and we spent the first hour or so <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-10-mar-16.jpg">mucking about</a> on the first beach we came to, which was Green Bay. As if on cue, there was an incredible aerobatics display over us on the island from an air force Hawk. Almost as if planned for <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-14-mar-16.jpg">Bryher's arrival</a> :)</p>

<p>Bryher is a great island. <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-15-mar-16.jpg">Very relaxed</a>. We wandered round the south end of the island, which was covered in <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-16-mar-16.jpg">wild flowers</a>. Spent a lovely time on Rushy Bay which fields <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-17-mar-16.jpg">soft and wild</a> at the same time. Stopped off at <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-18-mar-16.jpg">an ancient maze</a>. And finaly found <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-19-mar-16.jpg">a home away from home</a>  on Heathy Hill.</p>

<p>It really was a lovely week, with <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-11-mar-16.jpg">one lovely day on a beach</a> after another. Our cottage on St.Mary's was right on Porthcressa Beach, and every morning and evening Sarah would be out there - <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-12-mar-16.jpg">this was sunrise</a>. There was <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-13-mar-16.jpg">lots of life</a> to find.</p>


<p>We decided to take another boat trip and check out another of the 'off islands' - St.Martin's. The glass bottomed boat was in new hands and this was to be the new skippers first outing. It also turned out to be the finest day of the week, so we were lucky to get<a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-20-mar-16.jpg"> out among the Eastern Isles</a> on such a calm day. There was a lot of sea life to check out - <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-21-mar-16.jpg">these are Razorbills</a>, just arrived from their winter at sea and ready to start nesting. We were lucky enough to sea a big bull Atlantic Grey that had just caught a really large white fish. It proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes taking it apart on the surface.</p>

<p>After the Eastern Isles, we were dropped off on what felt like<a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-22-mar-16.jpg"> a very tropical St.Martin's</a> for the afternoon.  <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-23-mar-16.jpg">This panorama</a> is from a highpoint near Middletown called Knackboy Carn. We finished of the afternoon mucking about on yet another beautiful, empty beach - in this case, <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-24-mar-16.jpg">Lawrence Bay.</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the week, the weather turnerd stormy again. Rather than be stuck indoors, I did the obvious thing and <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-25-mar-16.jpg">hired a golf cart</a>! This allowed us to take in the whole of St.Mary's in a day. We headed right up to the north of the island to <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-26-mar-16.jpg">the Neolithic carn at Innisidgen</a>, with views over Crow Sound to St.Martins. We went to the Iron Age village and carn at Bant's Carn. Patrick seemed quite keen on the idea of <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-27-mar-16.jpg">a chambered burial for Bryher</a>.</p>

<p>With the weather turning stormy again, we decided to switch from sea to air. This is a happy family in<a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-28-mar-16.jpg"> the departure lounge</a>. Everyone was<a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-29-mar-16.jpg"> very excited</a> about the flight. It was a great first flight for Moss and <a href="../images/Scillies%20March%2016/scillies-30-mar-16.jpg">a great week for all of us</a> on the wonderful Isles of Scilly.</p>
