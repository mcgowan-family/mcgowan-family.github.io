<P>June got off to <A HREF="../images/Misc/ska-daddy.jpg">a cracking start</A> with the <I>Wychwood Festival</I> up at the race course. <A HREF="../images/Misc/peatbog-faeries.jpg">This mob</A> had made the trip down from Skye! Followed it up the next day with first serious Etape training as me and Crispin did 100 miler over the Malverns and back again.</P>


<P>Finally made a trip over to <A HREF="../travel/germany-2006.html">Germany</A> to see John, Steffi and Jamie.</P>

<P>Of course, making the flight would be too easy, so after <A HREF="../images/Misc/scream.jpg">missing check in by 10 minutes</A>, I got to be Ian and Pheng's first unplanned house guest in their new place down near Canary Wharf. The <A HREF="../images/UK/mill-dome.jpg">views at dawn</A> were fantastic - wish my head had felt as good.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
