<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Summer 2012</H1>
</DIV>


<P>Who wouldn't want <a href="../images/Family/daddy-birthday-0412.jpg">a firework in their birthday cake</a>?</P>

<p>Before the rain arrived for the summer, we got some <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-reservoir-0412.jpg">nice walks</a> in. This was at <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-reservoir-0412-02.jpg">Dowdeswell Resevoir</a>.</P>

<p>Who would have thought we'd ever see <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bhoy-0512.jpg">this shirt</a> getting worn again. Not sure who it was bought for - Michael or Dezmond maybe?</p>

<p>You wouldn't <a href="../images/Family/bryher-grins-0512.jpg">mess with her</a>.</p>

<p>Another lovely walk, this time <a href="../images/Family/chelt-river-walk-0512.jpg">heading up the Chelt</a> above Dowdeswell.</p>

<p>We got into the Jubilee mood, with <a href="../travel/stdavids-jun-2012.html">a cracking trip to Pembroke</a> with all our mates.</p>

<p>Sarah got to  fulfill a wish and<a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0612-01.jpg"> look after the Tapirs </a>at the Wildlife Park. they share their space with the Capybaras and Maras; including old Charlie. <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0612-02.jpg">Looks like she enjoyed it </a>:)</p>

<p><a href="../climbing/bernese-oberland-12.html">Popped across to the Alps</a> for a short weekend in the hills with Dave's Asbridge  Forman.</p>

<p>The summer was filled with lots of friends, old and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-giles-0712.jpg">new</a>. And funfilled family days with <a href="../images/Family/patricks-nose-0612.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/bryher-wellyboot-0712.jpg">Bryher</a>.</p>

<p>And let's not forget <a href="../images/Family/olympics-0712.jpg">the Olympics</a>!</p>

<p>A lovely way to round off the summer, was another week back out in <a href="../travel/dinas-aug-2012.html">Pembrokeshire</a>, this time with the added bonus of a wedding!</p>

<p>It felt like the summer was rushing to an end, so just before it did and Patrick started school, we squeaked in <a href="../travel/ilfracombe-sep-2012.html">one more cheeky weekend at the beach</a>.</p>

<p>And then it seemed like the summer really was over as August ran into September. The weather turned cooler and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-reception-day1-03.jpg">our wee boy started school</a> on September 6th. He seemed <a href="../images/Family/patrick-reception-day1-01.jpg">pretty pleased with the uniform</a> and he still looks like <a href="../images/Family/patrick-reception-day1-02.jpg">our wee boy</a> here.</p>

<p>Out of the blue, Patrick announced that he wanted to be a dentist. <a href="../images/Family/dental-treatment-01.jpg">Early days.</a></p>

<p>Steve, Jas and Schwinny moved into Flagstaff at the beginning of September. <a href="../images/Family/pierini-bbq-0912.jpg">What a great place</a>.</p>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
