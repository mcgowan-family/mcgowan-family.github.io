<p>Sadly, world events went from bad to worse in 2025. Donald Trump was re-elected for a second term. The war in the Middle East continued, and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepened. Trump's arrival put Ukraine on the back foot and it felt like we were now just fighting for the best ceasefire deal.</p>

    
<p>In that context, home was ever more a sanctuary of happy nights in front of the fire and wonderful trips away. Very occasionally it's hard to reconcile the two. Normally I just give thanks for the latter.</p>
    
<P>For the first time ever, we were all going to be going on <a href="../skiing/chamonix-25.html">a winter trip to the Alps</a> together. The last time Sarah joined us, she was still pregnant with Moss, so this would be new ground!</P>


<p>I ended up in Georgia, USA, with work and came across the one, the only, <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0325-01.jpeg">Lightning McQueen</a>! I also got to go to Phinzy Swamp and came across <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0325-02.jpeg">these little guys</a>. Shortly afterwards I spotted Mum, and backed away. Very slowly.</p>

<p>I had decided that this would be the year for me to reduce my hours and go part-time. I should have done it last year, but was so locked up in world events, it didn't occur to me until it was too late. This would give me time to start another project - the barn. But first, I would need to build the things needed to build the barn. That started with <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/shaving-horse-0425.jpeg">this shaving horse</a>, to make the pegs.</p>
    
    
<p>We had a great break at Easter to Leeds. Patrick loves everything martial and Leeds is the home of <a href="../images/Leeds-25/leeds-25-02.jpeg">the Royal Armouries museum</a>. Leeds has the feel of somewhere that a lot of investment has gone into over the past decade or so. Really <a href="../images/Leeds-25/leeds-25-01.jpeg">smart town centre</a>. The Royal Armouriies has <a href="../images/Leeds-25/leeds-25-03.jpeg">some wonderful displays</a> and unique bits of armour. This is Henry VIII's <a href="../images/Leeds-25/leeds-25-04.jpeg">wild horned helmet</a>. This is <a href="../images/Leeds-25/leeds-25-05.jpeg">an Indian armoured elephant</a>! Patrick was very happy :) In addition to all the stuff in the museum, our trip coincided with <a href="../images/Leeds-25/leeds-25-06.jpeg">an international jousting tournament</a> between UK, USA and Germany. The winning competitor was Emma Pearn, who happens to come from Stonehouse in Gloucestershire.</p>

    
<p>That trip had a lot of stuff that Patrick loved, but also coincided with my birthday! I'm 61, and although my joints give that away (see later) <a href="../images/Family/paul-birthday-0425.jpeg">I've never been happier</a>.</p>

<p>We went straight from Leeds into our next trip, which was one Sarah had wanted to do for a long time, to <a href="../travel/belgium-25.html">Brugges in Belgium</a>.</p>


<p>Just as everything was heading towards a lovely Spring, we had an event that was very bad, but could have been so much worse. I was dropping Moss at school on the morning of 2nd May. I had just started part-time, so I did drop-offs Thursday and Friday. We were using the van. I parked up, walked round the back of the van, only to see it start to roll back past me, with Moss still in it. I rushed to the back to slow it down, which I did, but it contoinued to slowly push me back over the tarmac towards the grass. When I reached the grass, I had no grip, and it quickly gathered speed. I told Moss to stay in the van (safer than jumping out) and I instinctively hung on to the back of the van. As it reached the slope and gathered pace, i just managed to get out from under the rear wheels. The rest is a blur, as it hurtled down the short slope and crashed into and through the tennis court fencing.</p>
    
<p> That fencing was just enough to slow The Colonel to a stop, but not before it had crossed the large kerbs <a href="../images/Family/van-tennis-0525-01.jpeg">into the tennis court</a>. I got dragged over the same kerbstones into the court, so there was a lot of bruising but amazingly no breaks (although see knee op in June). As usual, the tennis courts were full of Moss's school mates, getting ready to start their day. A couple of teachers watched on in shock, open mouthed, as this played out. As the van came to a halt, there was a stunned silence and then the teachers snapped back into life and started hustling the kids out of the court and up into school. The school were great. Mr Fathers (head master) rushed over to check we were both ok. Moss was understandably shaken up. We went up into the school and sat down in an office to have some water. I called Sarah and she came over to help look after Moss while I tried to sort the situation out. Moss agreed to go into school, which was the right call. <b>He was a superstar for the day</b> - 'Were you in it!", 'What was it like?', 'Did you think you would die!', 'How fast were you going??'. The van was damaged, but it could have been worse. Most of the damage was <a href="../images/Family/van-tennis-0525-02.jpeg">down one side</a>. <b>Moss was brilliaint throughout</b>. Obviously shocked, upset and processing it. But very brave and courageous to go into school that day. That was a big ask.</p>
    
<p>The Colonel started and I managed to drive him over the kerb, and the school agreed that Shiel the groundsman would pull us up the slope with the tractor. That worked and, somewhat unbelievably, we drove the van off the school grounds under our own power. We gave Shiel a very nice bottle of malt as a thank you. The handbrake was still up, when it came to a halt, so 'on', but clearly not 'on' enough. In retrospect, I could have tried to jump into the van and apply the footbrake, but of course if I'd missed the door, it would have rolled past me. The van is now in Frampton body shop for repairs. We won't be parking him on that hill again for a while.</p>
    

<p>Back at the Rectory, I finally finished painting all the windows (3 years later). That meant the scaffold was now free to do something else that I had wanted to do before starting work on the barn. The large Ash tree had huge boughs that overhung the barn site. I wanted to get them down before starting. It was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/ash-tree-prune-0525.jpeg">a pretty involved logging process</a> that took a week or two. <b>Patrick was a great help</b>.</p>
    
<p>In May, Moss got to do his <a href="../images/Family/moss-residential-0525-03.jpeg">Year 5 residential</a> down to Barton Hall in Devon near Torquay. Every day was filled with <a href="../images/Family/moss-residential-0525-01.jpeg">adventurous activities</a>. Looks like Moss took it all <a href="../images/Family/moss-residential-0525-02.jpeg">in his stride</a> :)</p>

<p>The gravel gang had planned to get into a rythm of two trips a year - spring and autumn. For ur Spring trip, we decided to double down o the advantage of having Will near the Dales and return north for <a href="../biking/north-moors-25.html">another grand adventure</a>.</p>

    
<p>Sarah had been getting much more into detecting and archaeology over the last few years. The garden was her happiest hunting ground, but this year, as well of lots of detecting at Stanway with Nichola, Sarah joined in quite a few organised archaeology digs. This one is organised by <a href="../images/Family/sarah-digging-0525.jpeg">Archeoscan at Slimbridge</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>Despite the damage to the van, the weather was warming, so me, Moss and Bryher set up <a href="../images/Camping/garden-camp-0525.jpeg">Garden Camp 2025</a>!</p>
    
<p>The plan had been to return to Scythe Fest with the van in 2025. Sadly that was not to be. But we had the new tent and I was delighted that everyone wanted to come along. The weather was damp on the way down, so we detoured into Glastonbury to give it a chance to dry up. It turned out to be <a href="../images/Camping/scythe-fest-0525-01.jpeg">the Abbey's open day</a> - bonus. Sarah even found a little known carving on the inside wall of the main chapel! We used the new tent Crispin had brought back from States to camp at Scythe Fest. Everyone enjoyed themselves. Sarah got to try some <a href="../images/Camping/scythe-fest-0525-02.jpeg">lovely local cheeses</a>, Patrick got a bill hook!, Bryher got a lovely top and Moss got a cracking wooden katana.I got to enjoy everyone enjoying themselves and we even <a href="../images/Camping/scythe-fest-0525-03.jpeg">got to see some scything </a>:)</p>
    
    
<p>I was fortunate to receive an honour in this years New Years Honours list. Not really something I had ever aspired to, but I knew it would mean a lot for the family and a wonderful way for them to feel some of the specialness of what we get to contribute to. It was a great couple of days.</p>
    
<p>We travelled down the night before and stayed in some great rooms close to <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-01.jpeg">the Central railway station</a>. Next morning, we got all togged up and headed up to <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-02.jpeg">the castle</a>. Everyone looked very smart! This is us in front of <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-03.jpeg">St.Georges Chapel</a>. The castle was closed, other than for investitures, so it felt quite special wandering around, being directed by friendly staff, who also took this picture in <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-04.jpeg">the Quadrangle</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>We headed inside to the State rooms. Patrick was wowed by more armoury and weaponery collections, including the bullet that killed Nelson :) We all waited in the Waterloo Chamber with the other families. David Moyes (Celtic West Ham & Everton) was <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-09.jpeg">also getting an award</a> that day. Me and Moyes ended up next to each other in the line, so we had a good chat. He wished he'd worn a kilt :) Then it was time for <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-07.jpeg">the presentation</a> and pictures in <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-08.jpeg">St.George's Hall</a>. We slowly made our way back out, taking in lovely views down <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-05.jpeg">the Long Drive</a> and checking Mossy out for size in one of <a href="../images/Family/windsor-0625-06.jpeg">the Guard's box</a>. </p>


<p>Now, you know what they say about 'pride before a fall'? Well, just when everything was going so well, I rolled over in bed half way through June, and the prosthetic in my left knee <a href="../images/Family/knee-200625.jpeg">came apart</a>. Suboptimal. The meniscal bearing squirted out to the medial side and the metal componets collapsed on themselves. Hence having time to catch up on website! Surgery next Monday, 30th June.</p>
