<P>Covid was finally moving from pandemic into endemic. There were still a lot of things that were differnt from before, but increasingly that was down to personal preference as opposed to central government direction.</P>


<p>My year started with the decision to get <a href="../images/Family/left-knee-0322.jpeg">a half-knee replacement </a> done on my left knee. It had been increasingly hard to keep up with normal family life in 2021. Delighted to say it all seems to be going well so far. By summer I was able to get back to all the stuff I enjoy doing with Sarah and the kids.</p>

<p>A sure sign of spring is <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/magnolia-0322.jpeg">the magnolia in bloom</a>. This year, I've added a few more fruit trees, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/almond-0322.jpeg">including this almond</a>, to begin to replace the older fruit trees that are dying. The bees were out chasing the blossom, so it was time for <a href="../images/Family/beekeeper-0322.jpeg">the first inspection</a> of the year.</p>

<p>Easter provided the opportuity for another great local trip to a new destination of <a href="../travel/lympstone-apr-2022.html">Lympstone in South Devon</a>.</p>


<p>Bryher was finally going to get some pets - Guineau Pigs! But first we had to sort somewhere for them to live, which meant <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-home-0422.jpeg">moving home</a>. And then they were here - <a href="../images/Family/coco-0522.jpeg">this is Coco</a>.</p>

<p>In May, I had the chance to visit somewhere I had <a href="../travel/jerusalem-may-2022.html">always wanted to see</a>.</p>


<p>Patrick had started his Duke of Edinburgh journey and was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-ccf-0422.jpeg">going for Bronze</a>. His physical section was around increasing his mountain bike skills, which gave us a great opportunity to spend time together <a href="../images/Family/patrick-doe-0422.jpeg">down in the FoD</a>! In June, we got everyone down to the FoD for the <a href="../images/Family/fod-0622.jpeg">traditional Family Trail outing</a>. This was Moss's first cicuit under his own steam!</p>

<p>June saw the celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and we hosted a '<a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/platinum-jubilee-0622.jpeg">street party</a>'in the conservatory. It was a lovely affair. And in a very different commemoration, Sarah got to inter Peter's remains over the road in <a href="../images/Family/peters-stone-0622.jpeg">St.Peter's churchyard</a>.</p>


<p>A rain shower in the late eveningproduced <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/sunset-0622-1.jpeg">an amazing effect</a> over the house. The air itself seemed to be lit up with <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/sunset-0622-2.jpeg">an eerie amber glow</a>.</p>

<p>Moss's team <a href="../images/Family/moss-relay-0722.jpeg">won the house relay</a>! Well done Moss :)</p>

<p>In July we spent a fabulous couple of weeks in <a href="../travel/mousehole-jul-2022.html">Mousehole in Cornwall</a>!</p> 

<p>In August, the boys headed North in what might become a feature of the years ahead - <a href="../travel/scotland-aug-2022.html">a Summer Road Trip to Scotland</a>!</p>

<p>We came back from Scotland and went straight into <a href="../images/Family/moss-is-7.jpeg">Moss's birthday</a>.We had a few of his little mates around. Just enough to <a href="../images/Family/moss-7-party.jpeg">fit into the trailer</a> :) I honestly can't recall what this was in aid of, but <a href="../images/Family/moss-robot.jpeg">it's a cracker</a> :)</p>


<p>A school contact of Sarah's turned into this <a href="../images/Family/llama-trekking.jpeg">lovely llama trek</a> in the Forest of the kids.But soon the summer was over and it was <a href="../images/Family/first-day-23.jpeg">back to school</a>!</p>
    
    
<p>Our story with Jamie continues. He has moved out of Traben into a small group hostel in Longkamp.<a href="../images/Family/jamie-gerry-sep-23.jpeg"> Me and Gerry paid him a visit</a>, with the usual shopping splurge, in September 23. There is much risk ahead, but I am more hopeful than I have been so far, that he may overcome the challenges of his beginning.</p>
    
    
<p>The kids are getting more into birding. Bryher is particularly keen. this is her at <a href="../images/Family/bryher-slimbridge-1023.jpeg">Slimbridge in October</a>.Moss is also keen, and he had the unexpected bonus of <a href="../images/Family/moss-slimbridge-1023.jpeg">ringing the bells</a> in the tower of St.John the Evangelist in Slimbridge.</p>
    
<p>We enjoyed a lovely day in Bristol in late October. It was Bryher's birthday and we went to <a href="../images/Family/wake-the-tiger-1.jpeg">'Wake the Tiger'</a> , which was described as <a href="../images//Family/wake-the-tiger-2.jpeg">an amazement park</a>! We managed to squeak in <a href="../images/Family/bristol-aquarium-1023.jpeg">a visit to the aquarium</a> as well.</p>
    
    
<p>Half way through December, it started to snow. <a href="../images/Family/snow-day-dec23-1.jpeg">It snowed all day</a> and into the night. The storm was pretty local to the Cotswolds, with Cheltenham getting more than most. And then it was freezing cold for a whole week, so it stayed perfectly for the whole week, with <a href="../images/Family/snow-day-dec23-2.jpeg">lots of fun days</a> on the hill :)</p>
    
<p>Just before Christmas, we headed down to London for a couple of days. We headed to <a href="../images/London-23/london-dec23-2.jpeg">the Tower</a> and had a great guided tour from <a href="../images/London-23/london-dec23-1.jpeg">the Yeoman Wardens</a>. The lights were <a href="../images/London-23/london-dec23-3.jpeg">as good as ever</a>. We happened to be there as the tree was being lit in <a href="../images/London-23/london-dec23-4.jpeg">Trafalgar Square</a>. Although <a href="../images/London-23/london-dec23-5.jpeg">Moss had been to London before</a>, it is likely this will be the trip he will remember the most.Towards the end of our trip, we managed to walk into some great seats to see Sir Ian McKellen play <a href="../images/London-23/london-dec23-6.jpeg">Mother Goose</a> at the wonderful Duke of York theatre in St.Martin's Lane. </p>
