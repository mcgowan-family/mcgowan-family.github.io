<p>Following the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel in October, the conflict in Gaza got rapidly worse as 23 turned into 24. Civilian casualties rose in an unprecedented way. This was a direct consequence of the territory Hamas had taken the fight to, coupled with the scale of loss of Palestinian life that the IDF would tolerate to take out a target. I hope for a ceasefire this year, but the legacy of this war will be multi-generational.</p>


<P>The operation on my left foot was gradually healing (<a href="../images/Family/my-left-toe-0124.jpeg">before and after shot</a>). As ever, my bone seemed to take longer to fuse than the consultants expected, and during the year, one of the screws began to back out. So I will need to have that removed at some point.</P>


<p>The huge beech tree below the Court unexpectedly and sadly <a href="../images/Pals/fallen-beech-0124.jpeg">came crashing down</a> one night in January.</p>

<p>The senior school production this year was <i>Legally Blond</i>. Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/school-play-0224.jpeg">a nice role</a> in it.</p>
    
    
<p>Half-term was coming up. Normally I would take the kids skiing to Chamonix, but with Patrick doing his GCSE's, and it being Sarah's birthday, it seemed sensible to keep things more local. We decided to all head up to Scotland to Braemar. We might get some skiing in at Glen Shee, but hopefully it would be a nice winter's break in a lovely part of <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-26.jpeg">Royal Deeside</a>. It turned out <a href="../travel/scotland-feb-2024.html">much better than we could have hoped</a>.</p>

    
<p>Sarah is still making amazing finds around the garden. This <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/silver-farthing-0324.jpeg">hammered silver farthing</a>, from the reign of Edward III, was one of the better ones in 2024. The <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/magnolia-0324.jpeg">Magnolia flowered</a> in mid March - feels early.</p>

<p>I was in the US with work in March. The hire car company asked if I <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0324-01.jpeg">minded having a truck</a> - nope :) I hadn't realised that Augusta as well as home to the Masters, was home to <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0324-02.jpeg">James Brown</a>. Downtown Augusta has a nice faded, vintage feel. I was taken by <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0324-03.jpeg">this signage</a>.</p>


<p>Sarah has a new <a href="../images/Pals/tanya-0324.jpeg">very best friend</a> - Iryna's mum, Tanya. Moss got to do a nice musical recital at <a href="../images/Family/moss-town-hall-0324.jpeg">the Town Hall</a> and Bryher read her poem with Ines.</p>
    

<p>Easter was at the end of March and the kids <a href="../images/Family/moss-bryher-bake-0324.jpeg">were all baking</a>. Easter Sunday lunch was very splendid <a href="../images/Family/easter-sunday-0324.jpeg">in the dining room</a> with the fire on. We had a few day trips, down <a href="../images/Family/moss-zeiss-hide-0424.jpeg">to Slimbridge</a> and a day in Bristol in <a href="../images/Family/bristol-museum-0424.jpeg">the excellent museum</a> there. Moss <a href="../images/Family/moss-mouse-0424.jpeg">made a new mate</a>, but sadly it didn't last :( And of course, the <a href="../images/Family/family-fod-0424.jpeg">traditional bike outing</a> to the Forest of Dean!</p>
    
<p>Patrick was having a break from DoE this year due to GCSEs, so it was Bryher's turn :) She did bird-watching with Ines and rock-climbing with Ines and Amy. This is Bryher in <a href="../images/Family/bryher-climbs-0424.jpeg">a nice composed space</a>, thinking about her next move.</p>

<p>Soon it was April and I was 60 :) Sarah arranged <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-01.jpeg">a lovely day out with friends</a> in a new bit of the Forest at a village called Newlands, with a great pub called the Ostrich. The walk headed down into Valley Brook, with <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-05.jpeg">plenty for the kids</a> to look at. We had <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-02.jpeg">a drum up</a> on the way back up to Astbridge Wood. The weather had been very kind, but the wind made it <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-04.jpeg">tricky for candles</a>! Everyone seemed to have <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-03.jpeg">a lovely time</a>, and a great way to spend my birthday :)</p>

<p>In the early May Bank Holiday we headed west to the Brecons for a walk in what they call <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-01.jpeg">Waterfall Country</a>. We were lucky with the weather again. Enough rain had fallen to make <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-02.jpeg">the falls interesting</a>, but not so much to make the trails difficult. We scrambled up to <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-03.jpeg">all of the falls.</a> The last fall is great as you can get <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-04.jpeg">in behind it</a>. We got <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-05.jpeg">a little bit wet</a> on that one.</p>
    
<p>In mid May, we decided to get the gang back together and set out on our next bike-packing adventure. Our inaugural outing was reasonably sporty, but for the difficult second album, and as an homage to maturing vintage, we went even larger. It was to be <a href="../biking/cairngorm-mountains-24.html">a Grand Tour de Cairngorms</a>! What could possibly go wrong ...</p>


<p>Moss had his first residential break away with the school in May. They all seemed to have <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-residential-0524-01.jpeg">a great time</a>. But I'm not sure <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-residential-0524-02.jpeg">how much sleep</a> they got!</p>

<p>The plastercast on my arm, was making everything a little awkward, but as ever, I was keen to keep doing as much as possible. We were leaving large areas of the grass to grow into meadows now, and I had decided that I would try using a scythe to cut them this year. That meant me and Moss were <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-01.jpeg">off to Scythe Fest 24</a>! It would all be a lot harder with one hand, but I had <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-02.jpeg">my little helper</a> :)</p> 

<p>The festival was down in Somerset. We took the train to Taunton and had a nice lunch before catching a bus to Langport and walking from there to the campsite at Thorney Lakes. En route, we visited the lovely abbey at Muchelney. The festival had a lovely vibe with lots going on. Moss enjoyed <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-03.jpeg">an artisanal maze</a>, got a lot of attention from <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-04.jpeg">Big Bird</a> and made friends with <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-05.jpeg">the Wand Man</a>.</p>

<p>It was a long day in the sun, and it was good to sit down and <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-06.jpeg">take in a show</a>. This is <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-07.jpeg">Sam Smith the blacksmith</a>, who looked like somethig from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Me and Moss got a round of applause for completing <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-08.jpeg">this puzzle</a>. We even <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-09.jpeg">watched some scything</a>! And to complete the cycle, Moss got to help <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-10.jpeg">pack up the maze</a> and we walked the shadow puzzle :)</p>

    
<p>Patrick finished his GCSEs. He studied really hard for them, so whatever the outcome, he has done really well. I'm looking forward to <a href="../images/Family/finger-pins-0624.jpeg">getting my left hand back</a>! Not being able to use it, meant that me and Gerry couldn't drive to Germany to watch Scotland in the Euros with Jamie :(</p>

<p>As the school year drew to an end, Patrick had a nice <a href="../images/Family/patrick-yr11-prom-0624.jpeg">prom pre-party</a> at the Rectory with his mates and Sarah enjoyed <a href="../images/Family/mum-school-drinks-0724.jpeg">drinks with her mates</a> at the school :)</p>
    
    
<p>We thought this might be the last year when all the kids would enjoy Disney. So in July we took the opportunity of <a href="../travel/paris-24.html">a few days over in Paris</a> to see the city and take in Eurodisney.</p>
    
    
<p>In August we had a fabulous week on the south coast, in and around <a href="../travel/gosport-24.html">the historic Portsmouth dockyard</a>.</p>
    
<p>I  put Scythefest into practice in August and cut the hay. I tedded it for a week or so and then one fine afternoon just before the good weather broke, <a href="../images/Family/gathering-hay-0824.jpeg">we gathered in the hay</a>!</p>
    
    
<p>September was <a href="../images/Family/first-day-0924.jpeg">back to school</a>. Patrick is in a suit for Sixth Form, but he happened to be in tracksuit for this one. Pete T had renovated a lovely little MX-5 with his daughter and as a bit of a bonding trip, they took it round the North Coast 500. He was good enough to drop in on <a href="../images/Pals/pete-bench-0924.jpeg">the Bench at Achmelvich</a>.And there were still some lovely days towards <a href="../images/Old%2520Rectory/misty-field-0924.jpeg">the tail end of Summer</a>.</p>

<p>I had a work trip to Canada in September. The trip was uneventful, apart from me <a href="../images/Work/montreal-0924-01.jpeg">buying a skeleton</a>, but we had a cancelled flight at the end which meant we had to spend a day in Montreal. It turned out to be a treat! We had a lovely meal on <a href="../images/Work/port-stanley-0120-02.jpg">Crescent Street</a>. We took in the World press Photo expostion in Bonsecours Market. I found this image of <a href="../images/Work/port-stanley-0120-03.jpg">a man mourning his dead daughter</a> in the aftermath of the Turkish/Syrian earthquake exceptionally moving. We even fitted in a nice boat trip on the St.Lawrence River.</p>
    
    
<p>As October wore on, it was time for our next bike packing adventure. This time it was Will's choice and he was going for <a href="../biking/north-moors-24.html">a home patch in Lancashire</a> and some trails that he had wanted to ride for a while.</p>
    
<p>Gerry and me had planned to go see Jamie in 2024. Our trip had been planned for June, but my broken hand put paid to that. We finally got to go in October. Earlier in 2024, he had to leave his accommodation in Longkamp. He spent a short while with nowhere to live, but had recently secured a room in Morbach. His room was sparsely furnished, so we spent a very busy weekend buying lots of furniture that <a href="../images/Family/jamie-1024-01.jpeg">we crammed into our small rental</a> and buying <a href="../images/Family/jamie-1024-02.jpeg">lots of very trendy clothes</a>. As ever, it was <a href="../images/Family/jamie-1024-03.jpeg">good to reconnect</a> for a couple of days and we certainly made a difference in his living conditions.</p>    

<p>The end of the month was marked by Halloween. <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1024-01.jpeg">Bryher was getting ready</a> for a party to coincide with her birthday. Her pals all <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1024-02.jpeg">got into the spirit</a> of the day. Moss went round the houses with Emily and Pippa. <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1024-03.jpeg">This is Moss</a> as <i>Slappy</i></p>
    
    

<p>Dave is 50 this year. To mark the occasion, Julie organised <i>Spiffing Do 2!</i> A rare opportunity to <a href="../images/Pals/spiffing-do-2-01.jpeg">get dressed up</a>. It was a lovely evening and <a href="../images/Pals/spiffing-do-2-02.jpeg">Dave seemed to enjoy himself</a> :)</p>
    
<p> Patrick turned 17 this year!And he still <a href="../images/Family/patrick-17-1224.jpeg">loves a good cake</a> :)</p>
    
<p>Out of the blue I heard from Yair towards the end of the year. He was passing throug London and was keen to cath up. It was lovely to see him and <a href="../images/Pals/yair-magdalen-1224-02.jpeg">he looked very well</a>. We met in Oxford and spent a very nice coupel of hours <a href="../images/Pals/yair-magdalen-1224-01.jpeg">wandering round the grounds</a> of Magdalen College.</p>
    
    
<p>We have had a bit of a tradition of taking the kids off to London just before Christmas for a short city break. We decided <a href="../travel/york-24.html">to go to York</a> for a change in 2024.</p>
    
    
<p>The year ended with our <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1225.jpeg">now traditional seafood feast</a> on Christmas day and we spent Hogmanay round at the Lads with Irina, Nilesh, Amy and Danny.</p>
