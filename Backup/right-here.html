<p>The conflict in Gaza got rapidly worse, as civilian casualties rose in an unprecedented way. This was a direct consequence of the territory Hamas had taken the fight to, but it was made  worse by the scale of loss of Palestinian life that the IDF seemed to find acceptable to kill a Hamas or PIJ operative.I hope for a ceasefire this year, but the legacy of this war will be multi-generational.</p>


<P>The operation on my left foot was gradually healing (<a href="../images/Family/my-left-toe-0124.jpeg">before and after shot</a>). As ever, my bone seemed to take longer to fuse than the consultants expected, and during the year, one of the screws bega to back out. So I will need to have that removed at some point.</P>


<p>The huge beech tree below the Court unexpectedly and sadly <a href="../images/Pals/fallen-beech-0124.jpeg">came crashing down</a> one night in January.</p>

<p>The senior school production this year was <i>Legally Blond</i>. Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/school-play-0224.jpeg">a nice role</a> in it.</p>
    
    
<p>Half-term was coming up. Normally I would take the kids skiing to Chamonix, but with Patrick doing his GCSE's, and it being Sarah's birthday, it seemed sensible to keep things more local. We decided to all head up to Scotland to Braemar. We might get some skiing in at Glen Shee, but hopefully it would be a nice winter's break in a lovely part of <a href="../images/Scotland-24/scotland-24-26.jpeg">Royal Deeside</a>. It turned out <a href="../travel/scotland-feb-2024.html">much better than we could have hoped</a>.</p>

    
<p>Sarah is still making amazing finds around the garden. This <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/silver-farthing-0324.jpeg">hammered silver farthing</a>, from the reign of Edward III, was one of the better ones in 2024. The <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/magnolia-0324.jpeg">Magnolia flowered</a> in mid March - feels early.</p>

<p>I was in the US with work in March. The hire car company asked if I <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0324-01.jpeg">minded having a truck</a> - nope :) I hadn't realised that Augusta as well as home to the Masters, was home to <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0324-02.jpeg">James Brown</a>. Downtown Augusta has a nice faded, vintage feel. I was taken by <a href="../images/Work/augusta-0324-03.jpeg">this signage</a>.</p>


<p>Sarah has a new <a href="../images/Pals/tanya-0324.jpeg">very best friend</a> - Iryna's mum, Tanya. Moss got to do a nice musical recital at <a href="../images/Family/moss-town-hall-0324.jpeg">the Town Hall</a> and Bryher read her poem with Ines.</p>
    

<p>Easter was at the end of March and the kids <a href="../images/Family/moss-bryher-bake-0324.jpeg">were all baking</a>. Easter Sunday lunch was very splendid <a href="../images/Family/easter-sunday-0324.jpeg">in the dining room</a> with the fire on. We had a few day trips, down <a href="../images/Family/moss-zeiss-hide-0424.jpeg">to Slimbridge</a> and a day in Bristol in <a href="../images/Family/bristol-museum-0424.jpeg">the excellent museum</a> there. Moss <a href="../images/Family/moss-mouse-0424.jpeg">made a new mate</a>, but sadly it didn't last :( And of course, the <a href="../images/Family/family-fod-0424.jpeg">traditional bike outing</a> to the Forest of Dean!</p>
    
<p>Patrick was having a break from DoE this year due to GCSEs, so it was Bryher's turn :) She did bird-watching with Ines and rock-climbing with Ines and Amy. This is Bryher in <a href="../images/Family/bryher-climbs-0424.jpeg">a nice composed space</a>, thinking about her next move.</p>

<p>Soon it was April and I was 60 :) Sarah arranged <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-01.jpeg">a lovely day out with friends</a> in a new bit of the Forest at a village called Newlands, with a great pub called the Ostrich. The walk headed down into Valley Brook, with <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-05.jpeg">plenty for the kids</a> to look at. We had <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-02.jpeg">a drum up</a> on the way back up to Astbridge Wood. The weather had been very kind, but the wind made it <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-04.jpeg">tricky for candles</a>! Everyone seemed to have <a href="../images/Pals/60-0424-03.jpeg">a lovely time</a>, and a great way to spend my birthday :)</p>

<p>In the early May Bank Holiday we headed west to the Brecons for a walk in what they call <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-01.jpeg">Waterfall Country</a>. We were lucky with the weather again. Enough rain had fallen to make <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-02.jpeg">the falls interseting</a>, but not so much to make the trails difficult. We scrambled up to <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-03.jpeg">all of the falls.</a> The last fall is interesting as you can get <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-04.jpeg">in behind it</a>. We got <a href="../images/Family/brecons-0524-05.jpeg">a little bit wet</a> on that one.</p>
    
<p>In mid May, we decided to get the gang back together and set out on our next bike-packing adventure. Our inaugural outing was reasonably sporty, but for the difficult second album, and as an homage to maturing vintage, we went even larger. It was to be <a href="../biking/cairngorm-mountains-24.html">a Grand Tour de Cairngorms</a>! What could possibly go wrong ...</p>


<p>Moss had his first residential greak away with the school in May. They all seemed to have <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-residential-0524-01.jpeg">a great time</a>. But I'm not sure <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-residential-0524-02.jpeg">how much sleep</a> they got!</p>

<p>The plastercast on my arm, was making everything a little awkward, but as ever, I was keen to keep doing as much as possible. We were leaving large areas of the grass to grow into meadows now, and i had decided that I would try using a scythe to cut them this year. That meant me and Moss were <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-01.jpeg">off to Scythe Fest 24</a>! It would all be a lot harder with one hand, but I had <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-02.jpeg">my little helper</a> :)</p> 

<p>The festival was down in Somerset. We took the train to Taunton and had a nice lunch before catching a bus to Langport and walking from there to the campsite at Thorney Lakes. En route, we visited the lovely abbey at Muchelney. The fstival had a lovely vibe with lots going on. Moss enjoyed <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-03.jpeg">an artisanal maze</a>, got a lot of attention from <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-04.jpeg">Big Bird</a> and made friends with <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-05.jpeg">the Wand Man</a>.</p>

<p>It was a long day in the sun, and it was good to sit down and <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-06.jpeg">take in a show</a>. This is <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-07.jpeg">Sam Smith the blacksmith</a>, who looked like somethig from <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Me and Moss got a round of applause for completing <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-08.jpeg">this puzzle</a>. We even <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-09.jpeg">watched some scything</a>! And to complete the cycle, Moss got to help <a href="../images/Family/scythe-fest-24-10.jpeg">pack up the maze</a> and we walked the shadow puzzle :)</p>

    
<p>Patrick finally finished his GCSEs. He studied really hard for them, so whatever the outcome, he has done really well. I'm looking forward to <a href="../images/Family/finger-pins-0624.jpeg">getting my left hand back</a>! Not being able to use it, meant that me and Gerry couldn't drive to Germany to watch Scotland in the Euros :(</p>
