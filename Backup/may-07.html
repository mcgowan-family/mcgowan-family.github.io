<P>Me and Leo had an amazing week high up in <A HREF="../skiing/bernese-oberland-07.html">the Bernese Oberland</A> in early May.</P>

<P>Prep's continued for the Grand Fondo with a weekend round Snowdon at Harlech staying at Steve's uncle Chris's <A HREF="../images/Biking/fridd-farm.jpg">Fridd Farm</A>. Great spot.</P>

<P>Late May and it was time to get back to the Scillies for a weeks relaxing with Sarah (pic's to follow). Been lots of biking and climbing of late, so it was great to just chill for a week.</P>

<P>June started of with having some folks round to the flat. Uley provided the beer again. Very nice too.</P>
