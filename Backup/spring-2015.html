<P>Spring had a visit from various bits of <a href="../images/Family/family-visit-april-15.jpg">the extended Clan</a> from up North, the kids got to go to Weston on <a href="../images/Family/weston-april-15.jpg">a lovely sunny day</a>, the van finally went in the '<a href="../images/Camping/makeover-april-15.jpg">the big makeover</a>' and I had <a href="../images/Family/pauls-birthday-0415-1.jpg">another lovely birthday</a>.</P>

<p>We had been planning to stay on Lundy for a couple of years now, having viisted for the day a couple of years back. Well in late Spring 2015, we finally made it. <a href="../travel/lundy-may-2015.html">What a great trip</a>. </p>

<p>As we say each year, work on the house is never over. We finally started into <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/living-room-jun-15.jpg">the living room</a> in June. I had to add <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/ceiling-rose-jun-15.jpg">the ceiling rose</a>.</p>

<p>I can't recall why this started. It's either Cinco de Mayo, or <a href="../images/Family/sarah-sue-mex-jun-15.jpg">Auntie Sue</a> just had some spare Tex Mex stuff.But before you knew it, <a href="../images/Family/bryher-mex-jun-15.jpg">they were all getting in on the act.</a> <a href="../images/Family/patrick-mex-jun-15.jpg">Patrick</a> wasn't going to be left out. Maybe <a href="../images/Family/paul-mex-jun-15.jpg">more Ming than Mex</a>. But this is <a href="../images/Family/moss-mex-jun-15.jpg">going too far</a>.</p>

<p>In July, we had a great expedition by open canoe down the Wye with <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-1.jpg">the Pierinis and some friends</a>.This <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-2.jpg">Steve, Ash and Summin</a>. <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-3.jpg">Patrick and Bryher</a> did <i>really</i> well. We tied up at <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-4.jpg">the hostel at Welsh Bicknor</a>, but they had no places. So it was <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-5.jpg">back in the boats</a>, but we're still smiling, you can see Jenny and Meryl in this shot. And we finally got to <a href="../images/Camping/wye-valley-0715-6.jpg">camp late</a> at Symonds Yat.</p>


<p>Later in July, we <a href="../travel/shaldon-summer-2015.html">headed back to Shaldon</a>, which had taken over from Watchet as our Devon favourite.</p>

<p>So much of 2015 was taken up by the prep, arrival and aftermath of the latest member of the family. Jospesh Moss made his arrival <a href="../images/Family/jomo-stats-aug-15.jpg">at precisely 1045</a> on the morning of 14 August weighing in at a very healthy 9 lb 4 oz. <a href="../images/Family/night-before-jomo-aug-15.jpg">The night before</a>, sarah was certainly ready for the next stage. The moment of his arrival (the squeamish shouldn't open the link) <a href="../images/Family/jomo-first-moment-aug-15.jpg">was astonishing.</a> And Sarah was certainly feeling <a href="../images/Family/jomo-with-mum-and-dad-aug-15.jpg">it was all worthwhile</a> when we got to this point.</p>

<p>A day or so later and <a href="../images/Family/family-3days-2-aug-15.jpg">everyone got come see</a> the latest arrival. Bryher even got <a href="../images/Family/jomo-3days-aug-15.jpg">to feed him</a>! And then it was time to <a href="../images/Family/jomo-back-home-aug-15.jpg">take him home</a>.</p>

<p>He <a href="../images/Family/jomo-1week-1-aug-15.jpg">settled in</a> pretty quickly.  Was <a href="../images/Family/jomo-1week-2-aug-15.jpg">pretty cute</a> all the time as young babies are. And before you knew it, he was<a href="../images/Family/jomo-1week-3-aug-15.jpg"> part of the family</a>. Since then he's gone <a href="../images/Family/jomo-5weeks-sep-15.jpg">in leaps and bounds</a>, and he's fast asleep in the back room just now so I'm getting a chance to write this.</p>


<p>As we had done with Patrick when Bryher arrived, we wanted the kids to have some memorable days around the event, when it was still 'just them'. I took them down to Bristol, we <a href="../images/Family/kids-ferry-bristol-aug-15.jpg">crossed on the ferry</a>, had a reminder of what was <a href="../images/Family/the-joseph-aug-15.jpg">back at home</a>, went to <a href="../images/Family/kids-at-bristol-1-aug-15.jpg">@Bristol</a> and Bryher did <a href="../images/Family/kids-at-bristol-2-aug-15.jpg">a moon walk</a> (as you do). Meanwhile, later that same day, Moss had <a href="../images/Family/first-bath-aug-15.jpg">his first bath</a>!</p>

<p>Another day out was a trip down to the Forest of Dean. This was to be our first trip (for me, Bryher and Patrick) round the family cycle trail. <a href="../images/Family/fod-1-aug-15.jpg">Lots of enthusiasm</a> before we set off. Patrick doesn't look too convinced at <a href="../images/Family/fod-2-aug-15.jpg">the quarter way mark,</a> but Bryher seems pretty happy about it. But pretty soon, Patrick is <a href="../images/Family/fod-3-aug-15.jpg">ripping it up</a>. They are <a href="../images/Family/fod-4-aug-15.jpg">both full of it</a> just before the gnarly drop-off. And Bryher has <a href="../images/Family/fod-5-aug-15.jpg">a muddy bum </a>by the end of it. Another great day.</p>

<p>We had one last night <a href="../images/Family/night-in-treehouse-sep-15.jpg">in the tree house</a>, and then all too soon, it was <a href="../images/Family/back-to-school-sep-15.jpg">back to school.</a> Grandpa arranged for us to go see the owls over in Gloucester. Bryher loves <a href="../images/Family/bryher-barn-owl-sep-15.jpg">Barn Owls</a>. And this <a href="../images/Family/patrick-eagle-owl-sep-15.jpg">Eagle Owl </a>seems as big as Patrick.</p>

<p>Now I'm pretty sure <a href="../images/Pals/emily-one-1-sep-15.jpg">it wasn't their birthday</a>. And it certainly <a href="../images/Pals/emily-one-2-sep-15.jpg">wasn't his birthday</a>. It wasn't <a href="../images/Pals/emily-one-3-sep-15.jpg">their birthday </a>either. But it looked like it was <a href="../images/Pals/emily-one-4-sep-15.jpg">someone's birthday</a>. And <a href="../images/Pals/emily-one-5-sep-15.jpg">there were cakes</a>!! Of course, it was September 4th and <a href="../images/Pals/emily-one-6-sep-15.jpg">Emily was 1</a>!!!</p>


<p>August turned into September, and Gerry and Maureen came to meet the wee man. <a href="../images/Family/wee-mo-meets-jomo-sep-15.JPG">He was a big hit.</a> Then into October, and Ash, Chris and Brian came to visit. This is Bryher <a href="../images/Family/ash-bryher-1015.jpg">bringing the pain</a> to cousin Ash. But <a href="../images/Family/ash-jomo-1015.jpg">Moss made it better</a>. Then <a href="../images/Family/family-kitchen-1015.jpg">Caroline and John</a> dropped in on the way back from Spain! Looking <a href="../images/Family/caroline-treehouse-1015.jpg">very wistful</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, it was <a href="../images/Family/vulcan-last-flight-oct-15.jpg">the last flight of the Vulcan</a> and we're all very sad to see her go. Patrick was building<a href="../images/Family/hes-not-heavy-oct-15.jpg"> a big link </a>to his wee brother.</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 2015, we finally got to go to <a href="../travel/legoland-2015.html">Legoland</a>.</p>

<p>The next trip was at the end of October, when me and Patrick went doen to London with the Charlton Kings crew for a sleep over at <a href="../travel/london-oct-2015.html">the Natural History Museum</a>!!!</p>


<p>End of October can mean only one thing, so while <a href="../images/Family/moss-and-mum-oct-15.jpg">Sarah got all cuddly with Moss</a>, secret mice laid the table <a href="../images/Family/the-night-before-the-party-oct-15.jpg">in preparation for the big day</a> for a party.</p>

<p>Bryher was clearly <a href="../images/Family/great-to-be-six-oct-15.jpg">delighted to be six. </a>. It isn't all about the presents - or maybe it is. There was <a href="../images/Family/its-a-jigsaw-oct-15.jpg">a jigsaw</a>, and <a href="../images/Family/and-a-keyboard-oct-15.jpg">a keyboard</a> and <a href="../images/Family/and-a-pony-oct-15.jpg">OMG</a>!!! Yep, it sure is <a href="../images/Family/candles-oct-15.jpg">great to be six</a>.</p>

<p>And that was only the family party. Then we had to have friends round. So me and Patrick <a href="../images/Family/prep-for-halloween-party-oct-15.jpg">spooked up the greenhouse</a>,  an that night all the kids entered into the spirit.  I have to thank Martha Stewart for the game ideas. <a href="../images/Family/good-effort-oct-15.jpg">Good effort by Bryher</a>. <a href="../images/Family/great-costume-oct-15.jpg">Great costume </a>from Ashwin. That looks <a href="../images/Family/he-cheated-oct-15.jpg">suspiciously too good</a> to me.</p>

<p>Well <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/autumn-at-old-rectory-oct-15.jpg">Autumn was certainlhy upon us</a> now, but there were still plenty of nice days to venture out. This was Moss's <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-oct-15.jpg">first trip to the wildlife park</a> and this was a great walk up to <a href="../images/Family/horses-grave-oct-15.jpg">the Horses's Grave</a>.</p>

<p>To make the most of the venue, Sarah held a Bond girls party their for <a href="../images/Pals/girls-1-nov-15.jpg">Lisa's 50th</a>. It was <a href="../images/Pals/girls-2-nov-15.jpg">a nice night</a>. And of course we had to have <a href="../images/Pals/girls-3-nov-15.jpg">fireworks</a>! Looks like they all had <a href="../images/Pals/girls-4-nov-15.jpg">a good time </a>:)</p>

<p>School didn't want to miss out, so they had <a href="../images/Family/bumblebee-2-nov-15.jpg">a fancy dress day </a>as well. This may be the <a href="../images/Family/bumblebee-1-nov-15.jpg">best outfit </a>I ever get to make for Patrick.</p>


<p>It's Novemeber. <a href="../images/Family/pats-birthday-nov-15.jpg">Pat's birthday</a>. A lovely <a href="../images/Family/moss-nov-15.jpg">soft shot of Moss</a>.  Sarah love's <a href="../images/Family/mum-and-moss-nov-15.jpg">this picture</a>. And every evening, we get to put <a href="../images/Family/another-hard-day-1-nov-15.jpg">these two</a> wonderful kids <a href="../images/Family/another-hard-day-2-nov-15.jpg">to bed</a>.</p>


<p>December was upon us; always a busy month. Moss started <a href="../images/Family/first-food-dec-15.jpg">eating solids</a>. Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/bryher-concert-1-dec-15.jpg">a lovely concert</a> as an angel. Patrick prepared for his science party by making <a href="../images/Family/atomic-fusion-dec-15.jpg">fruit molecules</a>. .</p>

<p>Sarah and Tracey had arranged <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-1-dec-15.jpg">a great party</a> for Patrick & Oli.  It started off with a crime and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-2-dec-15.jpg">forensics</a> were used to solve it. Then the science got <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-3-dec-15.jpg">a bit squidgy</a>. Jake was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-4-dec-15.jpg">on good form</a>, Bryher was having <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-5-dec-15.jpg">a great time</a> and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-6-dec-15.jpg">Oli loved it</a> too. Maybe <a href="../images/Family/patrick-party-7-dec-15.jpg">not so many fireworks</a> the next time :) </p>


<p><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/christmas-2015.jpg">Christmas 2015</a> was upon us. Nice <a href="../images/Pals/stilts-dec-15.jpg">days out to Slimbridge</a> with MT and the kids. <a href="../images/Family/christmas-picture-dec-15.jpg">Nice and relaxed </a>at home. We went to see <a href="../images/Family/christmas-concert-dec-15.jpg">Peter and the Wolf</a> at the Town Hall - a new tradition I think. The wooden tree from last year was on the gate in time for <a href="../images/Family/christmas-candles-dec-15.jpg">Midnight Mass</a>. The table was <a href="../images/Family/tables-ready-dec-15.jpg">set in the dining room</a> for the first time since we moved in. And <a href="../images/Family/christmas-dinner-dec-15.jpg">Christmas dinner</a> was great. Grandpa had moved in upstairs by now and Grandma was just along the road by the Memorial.</p>


<p>After dinner it was down to the serious business of ripping open presents - <a href="../images/Family/patrick-presents-dec-15.jpg">Patrick</a>, <a href="../images/Family/bryher-presents-dec-15.jpg">Bryher</a> even <a href="../images/Family/moss-presents-dec-15.jpg">Moss</a>. And Dad got <a href="../images/Family/dad-presents-dec-15.jpg">a very unexpected present</a> that would come in very handy in the next year. So <a href="../images/Family/joseph-christmas-dec-15.jpg">a Merry Christmas to all</a> and to all a Good Night.</p>


<p>Christmas is also just a good break off work and school. and as usual we got up to a few things. We had an unprecedented, never before seen (and never since!) ful family outing to <a href="../images/Family/fod-dec-15.jpg">the Forest of Dean</a>. - great day. We did the races on New Years Day, which as usual was all about <a href="../images/Family/patrick-gruffalo-jan-16.jpg">the kids tent</a>. As ever, Patrick <a href="../images/Family/patrick-kisses-moss-jan-16.jpg">very attentive of Moss</a>. Just before we went back to work and school we went up to <a href="../images/Family/think-tank-1-jan-16.jpg">the Think Tank </a>at Aston Uni. It's a bit like @Bristol, but with more <a href="../images/Family/think-tank-2-jan-16.jpg">history of engineering</a>.</p>


<p>In January, in the usual serendipitous way, I finally got around to making <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-jan-16.jpg">the memorial bench</a> for Dezmond. What we actually made were some Ash slabs that we sawed out from a downed tree, but the remains make a great bench in a way that came together very naturally. Ideally, after doing some finishing fixings, I'll get to site it in Achmelvich later this year.</p>


<p><a href="../images/Pals/young-pals-jan-16.jpg">Lots of visitors</a> in January. <a href="../images/Family/chris-ash-jan-16.jpg">Ash, Chris</a> and Brian came down again - getting close to the big wedding!! And John and Caroline stopped in at the same time - so it was <a href="../images/Family/full-kitchen-jan-16.jpg">another full kitchen</a>. Some things you just <a href="../images/Family/caroline-moss-jan-16.jpg">can't get enough of</a>.</p>


<p>It looks like 2016 will be another good year for getting on with the Rectory. We finally seleected a landscaper to work with on the west terrace - Duncan Forrester - thoroughly good bloke. But as he decided he needed a mini-digger to finish levelling the site, I decided we should start into the wildlife pond - two birds with one stone. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-1-jan-16.jpg">Bryher was on the scene</a> of the crime in no time, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-2-jan-16.jpg">Patrick wasn't far behind</a>, Sarah came in <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-3-jan-16.jpg">to keep the first two </a>under control. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-4-jan-16.jpg">Who let her get on that</a>?!?!? We made<a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-5-jan-16.jpg"> a great job </a>of the hole. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-6-jan-16.jpg">A very big lorry</a> turned up to get rid of the spoil. And <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-7-jan-16.jpg">Steve and Nancy</a> helped us get the liner in.</p>


<p>But what about that terrace. Well, this is what it looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/ramp-summer-13.jpg">back in 2013</a> when we moved in. Then this is what it looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/terrace-1-jan-16.jpg">in January</a>. And <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/west-terrace-apr-16.jpg">this is what it looks like now</a> :) But having Duncan around was too good a chance to miss, so I sourced some <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/bigger-trailer-jan-16.jpg">amazing llimestone flags</a> from the site of the 12th century Studley Priory and we set about installing them outside the kitchen window <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/east-terrace-apr-16.jpg">to catch the morning sun</a>.</p>

<p>In parallel with the pond and the terraces, we were having a lot of internal decoration down. Andrew Bush had come on site and was busily transforming first the dining room and then the hall. This is what the dining room looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-4-0713.jpg">when we moved in</a>, and <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/dining-room-apr-16.jpg">this is what it looks like now</a> :) He's only started into the hall, so more on that later.</p>

<p>I almost forgot, we also had David Ruther on site, building <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/walnut-cupboard-apr-16.jpg">some fantastic cupboards</a> in two of the main bedrooms to match the originals in Bryher and Patricks rooms. That's a heck of a lot of work for a few months.</p>

<p>As Feb came around, Moss was starting to look <a href="../images/Family/moss-jeans-jan-16.jpg">more grown up all the time</a>, but he still knew <a href="../images/Family/bros-feb-16.jpg">who his big brother was</a>. And we all went out for <a href="../images/Family/yo-sushi-feb-16.jpg">our first ever sushi</a>!! And the pond was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-1-feb-16.jpg">now full</a>!!</p>


<p>Patrick and me were lucky enough to get off for <a href="../skiing/aosta-16.html">a weeks skiing at half term.</a> The girls stayed home with Moss this year, and <a href="../images/Family/mums-coping-feb-16.jpg">it all went swimmingly.</a></p>


<p>I got back from Italy and headed straight to Scotland the next morning for the <a href="../social/chris-ash-wedding.html">first of this years big two weddings</a>. </p>

<p>March came around and Patrick was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-pirate-mar-16.jpg">a very effective pirate</a> in the school play, we had another trip to <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-mar-16.jpg">the wildlife park</a>, the kids sported some <a href="../images/Family/hats-mar-16.jpg">gorgeous headgear</a> cousin Shell had made for them and then on St.Patrick's night, sarah and me <a href="../images/Family/date-night-mar-16.jpg">actually got to go out</a> !!!!! Not finished yet, but <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-mar-16.jpg">Dezmond's bench </a>is coming along nicely.  <a href="../images/Family/pond-pals-mar-16.jpg">Treehouse bud's</a>. Moss is starting to <a href="../images/Family/three-on-a-swing-apr-16.jpg">join in the fun </a>with the other two.</p>


<p>The big event in March was our <a href="../travel/scillies-2016.html">fantastic Easter trip to the Isles of Scillies</a>!!!</p>


<p>And to finish off the update, <a href="../images/Family/pauls-birthday-apr-16.jpg">another lovely birthday cake</a> with the kids on the new terrace.</p>
