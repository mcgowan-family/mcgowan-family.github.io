<P>In keeping with previous years, we planned a ski trip for the half term. Bryher had agreed to come this year on the grounds that I would teach them, rather than them go into ski school. That worked well for me, so we headed off for what turned out to be a great week at <a href="../skiing/le-grand-bornand-17.html">Le Grand Bornand</a>!</P>


<p>At the beginning of March, me and Sarah had a very rare night out and <a href="../images/Music/guy-garvie-0317.jpg">went to see Elbow </a>at the Carlsberg in Birmingham, It was BRILLIANT!</p>

<p>Spring arrived and with it lovely walks up to <a href="../images/Family/crippetts-0317-1.jpg">Crippetts</a> for <a href="../images/Family/crippetts-0317-2.jpg">a picnic</a> in the high meadow. I've no idea <a href="../images/Family/moss-0317.jpg">what inspired this</a>, I think he just found the dressing up box. Alex has his birthday party at <a href="../images/Family/flyup-417-0417.jpg">Flyup 417</a>.</p>

<p>It was obviously a warm spring, as Patrick decided <a href="../images/Family/metiviers-0417.jpg">to go for a dip</a> when the Metiviers came to stay. We finally went to <a href="../images/Family/jet-museum-0417.jpg">the Jet Age Museum</a> over at Innsworth in April. Emily is a regular visitor and there's nothing like <a href="../images/Family/play-picnic-0417.jpg">a play picnic </a>in the kitchen to keep them happy. Summer was obviously just around te corner, as <a href="../images/Family/tractor-0417.jpg">the tractor came out</a> and Moss was <i>very</i> happy.</p>

<p>For my birthday, we went down to the sea,<a href="../travel/lyme-apr-2017.html"> at Lyme Regis</a>.</p>

<p>As the weather warmed up and we were <a href="../images/Family/swing-0517.jpg">having fun in the garden</a>, it was also time to start working the bees. Sadly, Sarah had a really bad reaction to a bee sting, so bad that we had the paramedics rouund, but at least <a href="../images/Family/ambulance-0517.jpg">the kids were happy</a>! When Moss isn't beatig up his older siblings, he can look <a href="../images/Family/moss-swing-0517.jpg">very angelic</a>. It wasn't just Sarah who got stung. Apparently this is a good <a href="../images/Family/bee-sting-0517.jpg">Bo Selecta impression</a>. We headed up to Eastnor Castle in late May for a really good steam fair and Moss got <a href="../images/Family/eastnor-steam-0517.jpg">his very own ride</a> on one of the smaller engines. And Patrick rounded out May with this awesome <a href="../images/Family/water-slide-0517.m4v">slow-mo water slide</a> <video width="320" height="240" controls>
Ê <source src="../images/Family/water-slide-0517.m4v" type="video/mp4">
</video> on a first take!</p>



<p>The Triumph is <a href="../images/Family/motorbike-0617.jpg">always a big draw </a>when it comes out and the kids like nothing better than riding round the garden on it. It was warm enough now for a camp out, which is exactly what we did for <a href="../images/Family/wills-party-0617.jpg">Will Robson's birthday party</a>. Looks like Grandma is getting <a href="../images/Family/grandma-moss-0617.jpg">a soft spot for Mossy</a>. I moved to the NCSC last year and I'm <a href="../images/Family/no-10-0617.jpg">down in London</a> once a week.</p>

<p>Ever since Dezmond died, I'd had it on my <i>to do list</i> to create some kind of memorial in a place he loved. I never let go of the thought, and 12 years later in the winter of 15/16, a big Ash tree came down in Dave and Jules's garden. Me and Dave planked it up for some tables he was thinking of making, and when we looked at what we had left, I thought <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0116.jpg">it might be just right.</a> We put it <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0316.jpg">on one side </a>for it to season. And at the end of June 17, I brought it over into our garden to play around at <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0617.jpg">making some plinths</a> from the stone left over from the walls we had built. Everything looked good, and using a tralier borrowed from John Edwardes and the Land Rover we had just bought, I headed north on the morning of 5th July, pulling a trailer full of a log, stone, sand, lime and tools. I got to Achmelvich 10 hours later and went and <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-1.jpg">pitched camp</a> at the little hidden bay just north of the main beach. Gerry was already there, sleeping in Alberto's van in the Youth Hostel car park, so next morning we started to <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-2.jpg">lay out the foundations</a>. It took him a while getting down there, so I thought I better <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-3.jpg">take  a picture</a> ;) Brian rocked up the next day, just in time to have <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-4.jpg">a trial sit down</a>. And after 3 days, <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-5.jpg">it was done</a>. Defeinitely feels like <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-6.jpg">a fitting memorial</a>. The memorial is bronze and was cast in Bridport Foundry. It went down well with all the campers who now have somewhere to eat their fish & chips. As I <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-0717-7.jpg">headed off south</a>, I got a call from Andy Summers, the very kind and helpful Highland Council Ranger who had allowed me to build the bench on National Park land, to say that I had built it just to one side, on the private land owned by the campsite!! Apparently they weren't amused, but decided not to take it any further. Dezmond would have got a right laugh out of that!</p>

<p>On the way back from Achmelvich, I stopped in at Milngavie to catch up with the newest member of the family - <a href="../images/Family/michael-fionn-0717.jpg">Fionn</a>. Fionn is 5 months old in this picture.</p>

<p>July had lots more outdoors in it. We went to <a href="../images/Family/air-tattoo-0717.jpg">the Air Tatoo</a> at Fairford, where Patrick and Moss had a double-decker view. Our summer camp with Will, Jojo, Dave, Jule, Emily, Beth, Steve, Seth and Immi was at <a href="../images/Family/camping-0717-1.jpg">St.Briavels in the Forest of Dean</a>, which turned out to be a great spot with lots to do. We went to the <a href="../images/Family/dean-railway-0717.jpg">Dean Forest Railway</a>. Went biking on <a href="../images/Family/fod-0717.jpg">the family trail</a>. Found a lovely walk down <a href="../images/Family/camping-0717-2.jpg">a wooded stream</a>. And checked out <a href="../images/Family/camping-0717-3.jpg">St.Briavels Norman castle</a>. We had our own little <a href="../images/Family/summer-camp-0817.jpg">summer camp in the garden</a> - I think that might become a feature. And I built a bit of a <a href="../images/Family/base-camp-0817.jpg">base camp for the Landy</a> - just because I could :)</p>

<p>In August we took ourselves off to <a href="../travel/falmouth-aug-2017.html">Falmouth</a> for a lovely week.</p>

<p>The summer holdidays were here. Lots of lovely walks, this one was to <a href="../images/Family/witcombe.jpg">Witcombe Roman villa</a>. <a href="../images/Family/dennis-margaret-0817.jpg">Dennis and Margaret</a> came over from Australia for a visit. We did a day trip to London and went to <a href="../images/Family/british-museum-0817-1.jpg">the British Museum.</a>. Patrick was amazed to find some <a href="../images/Family/british-museum-0817-2.jpg">Mayan remains</a> for his show-and-tell. And we were amzed by <a href="../images/Family/british-museum-0817-3.jpg">Saxon hordes</a>! We couldn't go to London and not take Bryher to <a href="../images/Family/m-and-m-0817-1.jpg">the M&M store</a>. And <a href="../images/Family/m-and-m-0817-2.jpg">Patrick came too</a>. And everyone enjoyed <a href="../images/Family/lego-store-0817.jpg">the Lego Store</a>. We finished off the day with a fun meal in <a href="../images/Family/chinatown-0817.jpg">Chinatown</a>!</p>

<p>It was September, so <a href="../images/Pals/emilys-three-0917.jpg">Emily must be three</a>! And in September, it's time to go <a href="../images/Family/first-day-0917.jpg">back to school</a> :( New for 2017, Bryher has <a href="../images/Family/bryher-violin-0917.jpg">picked up the violin</a>.</p>


<p>We really pushed the boat out in October and <a href="../travel/sardinia-oct-2017.html">took everyone off to Sardinia</a> for a late break in the sun.</p>

<p>We squeezed in one last trip to <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-1017.jpg">the Wildlife Park</a> before winter set in. Bryher had a little <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1017.jpg">Halloween party</a> for her birthday with her friends when we got back from Sardinia. We checked out a new feature at Matson ski slope - <a href="../images/Family/battle-hill-1117.jpg">Battle Hill </a>laser tag. But it would be a couple of months before we actually got to do it. Bryher was doing well with her <a href="../images/Family/bryher-violin-1217.jpg">violin lessons</a>.</p>

<p>Winter was upon us and one thing on the list was to install a wood burner in the living room. It was sad to lose the open fire, but it was the only thing that would work with the way the chimney had been constructed. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/living-room-fire-1217-1.jpg">We got all the bits</a> laid out. Sarah was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/living-room-fire-1217-2.jpg">at the botom end</a>. I was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/living-room-fire-1217-3.jpg">at the top end</a>. And it <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/living-room-fire-1217-4.jpg">all worked out beautifully</a>.</p>

<p>It was December and as Christmas approached, that meant <a href="../images/Family/patricks-birthday-1217-4.jpg">Patrick's birthday.</a> We had booked up Battle Hill, but as the day approached, a firm forecast for snow was on the cards. And <a href="../images/Family/patricks-birthday-1217-1.jpg">that's what happened</a>. In fact so much snow, that <a href="../images/Family/patricks-birthday-1217-2.jpg">some trees came down</a>. So much snow that we had to cancel Battle Hill and <a href="../images/Family/patricks-birthday-1217-3.jpg">go sledging</a>. And we finished it up with <a href="../images/Family/patricks-birthday-1217-5.jpg">a snowball fight</a>!</p>

<p>There was a <a href="../images/Family/bryhers-carols-girls-college-1217.jpg">special Christmas concert</a> for Bryher this year at the girls college. <a href="../images/Family/star-wars-1217-1.jpg">The Last Jedi </a>was out  so of course we all went to see that. Although we did feel <a href="../images/Family/star-wars-1217-2.jpg">a little underdressed</a>.</p>

<p>And finally Christmas was here, and <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-1.jpg">Frank's lights</a> went up to mark the occasion. Sarah made <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-2.jpg">a lovely job</a> of ithe internal decorations. We managed to pull off getting Parick to wake up in <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-3.jpg">an entrely different bed</a> - clever old Santa. And Moss was <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-4.jpg">over the moon</a>. <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-5.jpg">Patrick and Bryher</a> looked pretty happy too!</p>

<p>A day after Christmas <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-6.jpg">the snow came down</a> again. We got some <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-7.jpg">local sledging </a>in. Bryher is starting to <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-8.jpg">get the hang of cocktails</a> - probably a bad thing! And we lit<a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-9.jpg"> the dining room fire</a> for the first time.</p>

<p>It was cold, so the snow stayed for quite a while and we got the benefit on <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-10.jpg">a lovely walk</a> up the hill. <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-11.jpg">The church </a>looked lovely in the sun and the snow. We made it up to <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1217-12.jpg">the Horses Grave</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of nice day trips over the holiday. This was down at <a href="../images/Family/fod-railway-1217-1.jpg">the Forest Railway</a>. Where the kids got the hang of <a href="../images/Family/fod-railway-1217-2.jpg">dial up phones</a>.</p>

<p>We popped down to @Bristol where Moss got <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol-1217-1.jpg">up close and personal</a> with some bubbles, and Bryher showed him <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol-1217-2.jpg">how to do it</a>.   As ever, the house building was popular, but Moss can get <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol-1217-3.jpg">in on the action </a>now as well.</p>

<p>And it wouldn't be the Christmas break without a trip down to Slimbridge to see the Bewick Swans. Well, <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1217-1.jpg">the frogs and toads</a> seem to be more of a draw, but it's all good fun. Moss just couldn't believe he got to hold <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1217-2.jpg">a Fire Salamander</a>.And joy of joys, <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1217-3.jpg">they have slides too</a>!!</p>

<p>there was just one more thing to do, and that was to reschedule the laser tag on Battle Hill for Patrick's birthday. After much faffing about, we agreed on Jan 7, just after the kids went back to school. It was a glorious sunny day and cold. <a href="../images/Family/battle-hill-0118-1.jpg">Patrick looks ready</a> for some serious guerilla warfare. <a href="../images/Family/battle-hill-0118-2.jpg">Kitty and Tilly</a>  look ready to show the boys how it's done.  Everyoine had <a href="../images/Family/battle-hill-0118-3.jpg">a great time</a> and I suspect <a href="../images/Family/battle-hill-0118-4.jpg">we'll be back</a>.</p>
