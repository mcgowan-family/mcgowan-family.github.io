<P>Caroline hosted Christmas dinner at her place in Clober road and <A HREF="../images/Family/xmas07-1.jpg">a good time was had by all</A> .....</P>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/xmas07-2.jpg">elegance and fair trade</A> - a winning combination</LI>
<LI>apparently <A HREF="../images/Family/xmas07-3.jpg">we all look alike </A>- I'm not too happy about that</LI>
<LI>it just wouldn't be Christmas without <A HREF="../images/Family/xmas07-4.jpg">Eddie Izzard</A></LI>
<LI>you'd never guess someone worked in <A HREF="../images/Family/xmas07-5.jpg">an outdoor store</A> :o)</LI>



<P>Straight after Christmas, I headed off skiing to <A HREF="../skiing/val-disere-07.html">Val d'Isere</A> with Alan, Andrew, Fitz and some other folk. Unfortunately, I took Ashleigh's flu bug with me!!!</P>

<P>Back in Cheltenham, Sarah convinced me it would be a good idea to take the bike down to Exeter ... in the middle of the night. Well it certainly was fun ... and cold. In fact, Sarah went down with the lurgy straight after. All actions have consequences. Talking of which, if you're ever down that way, under no circumstances use <A HREF="../images/Motorbiking/ilfracombe.jpg">this cafe</A>. Looks good, but it's really, really crap.</P>

<P>Next weekend a bunch of us headed up to Snowdon to do a bunch of stuff around the hills and valleys. Raph had booked this really great <A HREF="../images/Climbing/capel-0107.jpg">bunkhouse</A>. We went mountain biking on the <A HREF="../images/Biking/marin-0107.jpg">Marin Trail</A> at Betws on the Saturday and set off up <A HREF="../images/Climbing/tryfan-0107-1.jpg">Tryfan</A> on the Sunday.</P>

<P>Even managed to get down to Slimbridge by the end of the month. Never seen <A HREF="../images/Birding/slimbridge-0107.jpg">Swan Lake</A>, but they've got quite a good one :o)</P>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
