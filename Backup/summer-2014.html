<P>One of the biggest things that will happen to us this year, was Sarah selling her business, The Upper Crust. This was a really big step for all of us, but obviously mostly for Sarah. As a sign of the affection she was held in by her neighbours of many years, the guys down the road made her <a href="../images/Family/shop-cake-0314.jpg">this lovely cake</a>!</P>

<p>Life at home continues much as it has for the past year. There are <a href="../images/Family/party-bryher-0314.jpg">parties to go to</a>, we started into <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/kitchen-1-0314.jpg">the kitchen</a>, we ripped some <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/kitchen-2-0314.jpg">old stuff out</a>, we made some <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/kitchen-3-0314.jpg">holes in the wall</a> and it was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/kitchen-4-0314.jpg">very satisfying</a>.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to get <a href="../skiing/chamonix-14.html">a few days away</a> in the Alps with Andrew.</p>

<p>It was <a href="../images/Family/p&b-0414.jpg">a lovely Spring</a>. But on those damp days, there were plenty of <a href="../images/Family/bryher-climbing-1-0414.jpg">indoor options</a>. Apparently Bryher was very <a href="../images/Family/bryher-climbing-2-0414.jpg">good at climbing</a>. And <a href="../images/Family/patrick-climbing-1-0414.jpg">Patrick was great too</a> :)</p>

<p>We had an absolutely lovely week in <a href="../travel/shaldon-apr-2014.html">a little town called Shaldon</a>, on the south coast of Devon.</p>


<p>We're right into the beekeeping now. But <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/swarm-0414.jpg">it doesn't always go to plan</a>!</p>

<p>The birthdays kept coming. People tell me <a href="../images/Family/pauls-50th.jpg">this was a significant one</a>.</p>
    
<P>In May, I was lucky enough to join a great course run out of MIT in Boston. Among the many things I did there, one of the more memorable was spending some time, including sharing an evening meal, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Clark">Dave Clark</a>, one of the recognised pioneers of the internet. Among his many conrtibutions, is the classic line, "We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.".</P>

<p>And in a summer of sport when Brazil crashed out of the World Cup to Germany, Murray crashed out of Wimbledon, Mark Cavendish made it three by crashing out of a fantastic start to <a href="../biking/tour-de-france-14.html">the Tour de France 2014 in Yorkshire</a>.</p>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
