<P>The year of 2019 turned out to be quite a roller-coaster, but it all started in the Christmas of 2018 with <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1218-01.jpg">a quick trip to London</a>. I got to take everyone round the FCO <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1218-02.jpg">and Downing Street</a>. We went to <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1218-03.jpg">the Christmas Fare</a> in Hyde Park! <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1218-04.jpg">Moss was <i>very</i> happy </a>about that. and we played <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1218-05.jpg">family board games</a> till we ran out of money (turned out Patrick was hiding it all under the table). Moss got his first balance bike this year and was <a href="../images/Family/moss-biking.m4v">quickly putting it into action</a>.</P>


<p>We headed over to The Warehouse climbing centre in Gloucester in January. All three kids were great on the wall. <a href="../images/Family/climbing-0119-01.jpg">Bryher is looking very composed</a> here. <a href="../images/Family/climbing-0119-02.jpg">Patrick too</a>. Even <a href="../images/Family/climbing-0119-03.jpg">Moss got in on the action</a>!</p>

<p>Moss and the rest of the kids were always happy to go up and <a href="../images/Family/grandpa-0119.jpg">visit Grandpa at Spring Barn</a> in Cowley.</p>

<p>We had some great snowfall again this winter. If you have to go to school, this is <a href="../images/Family/snow-school-0219.jpg">one of the better ways to get there</a>.</p>

<p>We decided to go skiing this year, just Patrick and Bryher though. So it was <a href="../skiing/chamonix-19.html">back to Chamonix</a> in the February half-term.</p>

<p>Sarah had been quite poorly for over a year now, with symptoms that the medics were ascribing to change in hormone levels. Just before our ski trip, this had been re-diagnosed as a likely cancer and in March, it was finally diagnosed as Hodgkins Lymphoma. It was quite a shock of course, but actually for us, it felt positive to finally have a clear diagnosis that we could get after. She started into a course of ABVD chemo straight away.</p>


<p>One of the later snowfalls of the winter, turned into a lovely sunny day, just as <a href="../images/Family/magnolia-0319.jpg">the magnolia burst into flower</a>.The garden was starting to come back into use over winter for the kids. This shot makes me think Patrick has <a href="../images/Family/seesaw-0419.jpg">an unfair advantage</a>.</p>

<p>Moss was really <a href="../images/Family/robot-0419.jpg">coming into his character</a> this year.</p>


<p>Peter had had a number of scares over the years with cancer. In March, he was receiving some treatment for a suspected cancer of the pancreas. Unexpectedly, he went into a rapid decline and, on the 19th March, passed away in hospital, <a href="../images/Family/funeral-0419-01.jpg">with family around him</a>. It was a huge loss to everyone in the family and his wide circle of friends. There was <a href="../images/Family/funeral-0419-02.jpg">a  large service</a> at Gloucester Cathedral. Money raised by his friends in the masons has now been used to erect some amazing restored stonework in the north ambulatory area of the cathedral.</p>


<p>There was a long wait between his death and the funeral. Once the funeral was behind us, everyone needed a break, so <a href="../images/Family/dartmouth-0519-01.jpg">we all headed off</a> to Dartmouth for a week. Dartmouth turned out to be a good location with <a href="../images/Family/dartmouth-0519-02.jpg">lots of distractions</a>! <a href="../images/Family/dartmouth-0519-03.jpg">The weather was kind</a> all week. And the town had <a href="../images/Family/dartmouth-0519-04.jpg">a lovely, old seaside feel</a>. Sarah enjoyed it so much she went back with the girls later in the year.</p>

<p>One year on from my leg surgery and I felt well enough to go back out on the mountain bike. I managed to get quite a few good rides in over the summer. Only short ones <a href="../images/Family/leck-hill-0619.jpg">up Lecky Hill</a>, but it was lovely to be out on the bikes with friends again.</p>

<p>This was Patrick's final year at Leckhampton Primary. Every year, they take the year 6 children off to <a href="../images/Family/iow-1019-01.jpg">an adventure camp on the Isle of Wight</a>. It was a lovely way for them all to <a href="../images/Family/iow-1019-02.jpg">spend some time together</a>. Patrick was <a href="../images/Family/iow-1019-03.jpg">great at the archery</a> and the climbing.</p>

<p>It was now mid-summer and Sarah was right in the middle of chemo for her Hodgkins Lymphoma. The initial course of ABVD, had not had enough impact and, during the summer Sarah was put on a harsher course called BEACOPP14. this had a big impact on her general health, but <a href="../images/Family/comfort-0619.jpg">someone was always around</a> to provide some comfort.</p>

<p>There is always a silver lining, and the Lido is right next to the oncology unit. So we spent many days over <a href="../images/Family/pool-jump-0619.jpg">the summer at the pool</a>.</p> 

<p>The cancer treatment didn't stop us doing our normal summer things, we just needed to do them a little more slowly. So there were plenty of <a href="../images/Family/bbq-0719.jpg">barbecues and fire pit parties.</a></p>

<p>I can't recall the reason for this gathering. Might have been end of term at Lecky primary.But <a href="../images/Pals/lecky-lot-0819.jpeg">it's a good group</a>.</p>

    
<p>There was plenty of time to <a href="../images/Pals/rigazzi-0819.jpeg">just hang out</a> over the summer.</p>
    
<p>Ashleigh, Chris and Cora came down to stay over the summer. I got a nice bike ride in with Chris. Their visit coincided nicely with <a href="../images/Family/moss-4-0819.jpg">Moss's birthday</a>!</p>

<p>Chemo treatment ended in late August. We waited a couple of weeks and then, as Sarah was starting to feel a little better, we ventured slightly further afield. This was a lovely trip to the Glos Wildlife Trust place at <a href="../images/Family/greystones-0919.jpg">Greystones Farm near Bourton-on-the-Water</a>. Sarah had wanted to go there for a long time and she was able to do the long walk, including a  slightly unplanned detour! We popped down to Slimbridge where they had opened up a new <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0919.jpg">Siberian Research exhibit</a>.</p>


<p>The warm days of summer were starting to slip away, but <a href="../images/Family/moss-bubble-0919.m4v">there will always be time for more bubbles</a> ;0</p>


<p>And finally it was over. The summer holidays came to an end and, as part of two big changes, <a href="../images/Family/first-day-0919.jpg">Moss started in Leckhampton Primary and Patrick started at St.Edwards</a> Senior school.</p>

<p>The summer holdidays were over, but summer wasn't quite over yet :) Dave kindly invited us out to his squadron family day at Brize Norton. <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-01.jpg">It was brilliant</a>! This is <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-02.jpg">one of the A400's</a>. We climbed all over the airframe and had <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-03.jpg">plenty of time in the cockpit</a>, which was fully powered up. As expected, <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-04.jpg">Sarah was VERY HAPPY</a>! It was geat to <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-05.jpg">all be there together</a>. I'm sure the kids will <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-06.jpg">remember that forever</a>. After the airframe, we were allowed to go fly the simulator, which was an amzing treat. We all took off and landed successfully at Gibraltar airport. After the sim, we went over to the firing range. They use laser sights on all the weapons. this is patrick with <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-07.jpg">a shoulder launched missile</a>!! and this is Moss with <a href="../images/Family/brize-0919-08.jpg">a fully automatic grenade launcher</a> (that's probably a bit wrong, but he loved it :)</p>

<p>The year seemed to rush towards a close. I had a new job and was travelling a little more. Bryher was 10 and Patrick was 12. Patrick was gettig on well at school, as was Mossy. And before we knew it, <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2019-1.jpg">it was Christmas</a>. Looking back on the year, we certainly had <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2019-2.jpg">much to be thankful for.</a> We had had our losses as well, but with <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2019-3.jpg">three happy children</a> in the home, there would always be lots to looks forwards to.</p>
