<P>The bee story went from strength to strength last year. This is <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/uncapping-0714.jpg">us uncapping</a> and then <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/extracting-0714.jpg">extracting the very first honey</a>. Who knew we'd be producing our own honey in our first year at the Rectory :) We use a lot ourselves, give it to friends & family and sell it in work and down at Roots & Fruits on the Bath Road.</P>

<p>We had some regular company in the garden now in the form of <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/nelson-0714.jpg">Nelson the cat</a> from Eve and Chris's next door. A really lovely cat. Very old though (into his 20's) and unfortunately he died later in 2014.</p>

<p>Every day in the garden is a treat. And <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/firepit-0814.jpg">the evening's are pretty great too</a> :)</p>

<p>In August, we finally got to go down and stay at Thistledown near Nymphfield. Great campsite. <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-1.jpg">Patrick was looking cool </a>in some borrowed head gear. We all headed off for a walk down into the Woodchester Valley and found some <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-2.jpg">great swings</a> on the way. Further on down we came across <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-3.jpg">a great little boathouse</a> (Dave and a very pregnant Jules, Steve & Ash and the 4 of us).Bryher was looking <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-4.jpg">very cute</a> with a great big furry caterpillar! We eventually made it up to Woodchester Mansion which was <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-5.jpg">amazing</a>! Steve, Beth & Seth and Ian, Helen and Taryn were all there too. It made for <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0814-6.jpg">a nice camp</a> :)</p>

<p>In mid-August we spent <a href="../travel/watermouth-aug-2014.html">a great week camping</a> at Watermouth Bay near Ilfracombe.</p>


<p>Lots of of fun for the kids with their friends over the summer. I think this was <a href="../images/Pals/tubing-0814.jpg">Jake's birthday party</a> at Matson. And then we went over to Highnam and <a href="../images/Pals/highnam-0814.jpg">the Watts</a> joined us.</p>

<p>We went back to Ilfracombe in September and took Peter and Pat with us. We stayed at a fabulous little cottage on the hill over the harbour. Great spot with <a href="../images/Ilfracombe-14/ilfracombe.jpg">a lovely view of Ilfracombe</a>. <a href="../images/Ilfracombe-14/verity.jpg">Verity</a> was still holding dominion over the harbour. We went back to the fabulous Watermouth Bay Castle, and <a href="../images/Ilfracombe-14/gramps-boat-ride.jpg">grandma and grandpa went for a spin</a>. And to cap off the week, the Clyde steamer <a href="../images/Ilfracombe-14/waverley.jpg">Waverley paid us a visit</a>!</p>

<p>But the holidays were finally over, and it was time for everyone to go back to school. Patrick didn't initially get a place at Leckhampton, but that was great as far as he was concerned as he got to <a href="../images/Family/patrick-year2-0914.jpg">start into Year 2</a> with all of his old mates at Charlton Kings. Meanwhile Bryher was getting ready for the big day. Now I don't know if these things are connected, but around that time, she went for <a href="../images/Family/bryher-hair-0914-1.jpg">her first proper hair do</a>. The end result was certainly Bryher, but <a href="../images/Family/bryher-hair-0914-2.jpg">not as we knew her</a>! And then it was Bryher's turn to <a href="../images/Family/bryher-reception-0914-1.jpg">start into Reception at Leckhampton</a>. That's better, looks like <a href="../images/Family/bryher-reception-0914-2.jpg">my wee girl</a> again :)</p>

<p>As ever, the work on the house is never done. Painting the west side of the house felt like a great job, and <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/sarah-painting-0914.jpg">Sarah got stuck in</a>. As ever, we made it <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/paul-painting-0914.jpg">a family affair</a>.</p>


<p>We finally made good on our promise to head to <a href="../images/Family/peppa-1014-1.jpg">Peppa Pig World</a>. <a href="../images/Family/peppa-1014-2.jpg">These slides</a> were great fun and the kids enjoyed them too :) There was a train ride, which <a href="../images/Family/peppa-1014-3.jpg">always goes down well</a>. There were some big scary rides that <a href="../images/Family/peppa-1014-4.jpg">the boys</a> went on. And then there was <a href="../images/Family/peppa-1014-5.jpg">this monster</a> that we all went on!</p>

<p>October came and our wee girl was growing up, <a href="../images/Family/bryher5th-1014-1.jpg">but not too much</a>. Everyone crowds round the cake to sing <a href="../images/Family/bryher5th-1014-2.jpg">happy 5th birthday.</a></p>

<p>Autumn was <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1014.jpg">definiitely upon us</a>. Can't recall what was happening at school this day, but <a href="../images/Family/facepaint-1114.jpg">they obviously had fun.</a> The west face of the house had looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/scaffold-1114.jpg">a building site</a> for most of the year, but one day in Novemeber, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/no-scaffold-1114.jpg">it got to breathe again</a>.</p>

<p>Autumn was turning into Winter, and still the works went on. We had started into the conservatory with a vengeance. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/alan-conservatory-1214.jpg">Looking at it here</a>, you get a sense of the scale of the task.  As always, there were <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/cheltenham-brick-0115.jpg">nice wee bits of history</a> to discover. Then of course we had Patrick's 7th birthday, which he shared at a great <a href="../images/Family/patrick7th.jpg">Lego birthday party</a> with Oli.  <a href="../images/Pals/bryher-eva-1214.jpg">Bryher's friend Eva </a>got to come too.</p>


<p>Christmas was <a href="../images/Family/bryher-reindeer-1214.jpg">soon upon us</a>. It was a lovely <a href="../images/Family/Christmas-Day-2014.jpg">Christmas at the Rectory</a>. We made sure we <a href="../images/Family/Christmas-Gemini-1214.jpg">spread the Christmas cheer</a>. And then it was <a href="../images/Family/the-8th-dwarf-1214.jpg">baths all round</a> and, finally,  a good nights sleep. <a href="../images/Family/michael&geraldine-1214.jpg">Michael, Geraldine, John-Ross and Erin came to stay in just after Christmas</a>. Then we headed up to Glasgow in between Christmas and New Year and caught up with all the family up North. Patrick and Bryher <a href="../images/Family/cousins-1214.jpg">loved catching up</a> with all their cousins. And we all loved <a href="../images/Glasgow/kibble-1214.jpg">living in the West End </a>for a few days.</p>

<p>Back in Cheltenham, and Patrick started off the New Year by <a href="../images/Family/rugby-1-0215.jpg">getting into rugby</a> at Old Pat's for a few weeks. He certainly <a href="../images/Family/rugby-2-0215.jpg">seemed to enjoy it</a>.</p>

<p>Just before Winter was through, we all headed off to Chamonix for <a href="../skiing/chamonix-15.html">our first Winter Holiday</a>!</p>
