<P>This year began with the wonderful news that two new cousins had joined the clan - Cora Pearl and Ayla Pearl! Cora born to Ashleigh and Chris, and Ayla born to Michelle and Rob. We went up to <a href="../images/Family/cora-and-kids-0118.jpg">meet little Cora</a> straight away! Patrick and Bryher got to catch up with <a href="../images/Family/metiviers-0118.jpg">their other cousins</a> as well. I had a strange thing happen the week after little Cora was born. I ended up sleeping next door to <a href="../images/Family/cora-pearl-0118.jpg">the Cora Pearl suite</a> in the Grosvenor in London!! Lots of other very weird bits to that story that you couldn't make up.</P>


<p>We decided not to go skiing this year as it would have meant leaving Sarah at home for her birthday. Again! So instead we had <a href="../travel/copenhagen-feb-2018.html">a brilliant week in Copenhagen</a>!</p>
</p>

<p>Despite not skiing this year, we still got to play in <a href="../images/Pals/snow-fields-0318.jpg">an unusual amount of snow</a>. There were <a href="../images/Pals/patrick-dave-snow-0318.jpg">three big snow events</a> from December through to March, and we made the most of all of them <a href="../images/Pals/jules-emily-pip-snow-0318.jpg">with pals</a> :) Bryher really <a href="../images/Pals/bryher-slides-0318.m4v">nails the balance</a> <video width="320" height="240" controls>
Ê <source src="../images/Pals/bryher-slides-0318.m4v" type="video/mp4">
</video> on this one! Patrick was pushing the bounds of fair play with <a href="../images/Pals/patrick-dad-slides-0318.m4v">this overtaking manouevre!</a> <video width="320" height="240" controls>

</video></p>

<p>Bryher <a href="../images/Family/bryher-scotland-0218.jpg">took a side</a> during the 6 Nations! Patrick got <a href="../images/Family/patricks-day-0318.jpg">a special helper</a> for his special day. Me and Gerry went over to Germany to <a href="../images/Family/jamie-0318.jpg">link up with Jamie</a>.</p>

<p>I got yet <a href="../images/Family/dads-54-0418.jpg">another year older</a>! I spent it with friends and family.</p>



<p>Of course we haven't finished the house yet and this would be quite a big year. We finally started into the last reception room; which flips from being a play room to a morning room. But it started with <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/play-room-0418-1.jpg">opening up the fireplace</a>. Turned out there was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/play-room-0418-2.jpg">quite a lot of fireplace</a> to open.</p>


<p>The Metiviers came to stay, whcih was great. We went <a href="../images/Family/cousins-bristol-0418.jpg">down to Bristol</a> and had <a href="../images/Family/fire-pit-0418.jpg">fun in the garden</a></p>

<p>I don't think I was there when <a href="../images/Family/moss-as-fairy-0518.jpg">this happened.</a> As Spring kicked in, we went hunting frog spawn <a href="../images/Family/pilley-bridge-0418.jpg">at Pilley Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>I was working outside in the outbuildings as well. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/workshop-0518.jpg">The workshop </a>is really taking shape. And all around Spring was bursting out - <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/churchyard-0518.jpg">Forget Me Nots in the church yard</a>.  It was already warm and the kids were <a href="../images/Family/rat-pack-0518.jpg">making the most of it</a>. In a forecast of what was to come, Moss made sure <a href="../images/Family/moss-watering-0518.jpg">nothing dried out</a>. It was also time for our <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/summer-party-0518.jpg">first big Summer Party</a>. There was a royal wedding going on, and it was a great opportunity to get family and friends around. Wildlife was quite literally <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/chaser-0518.jpg">bursting out everywhere</a> (picture by Patrick).</p>

<p>The warmer weather was a good chance to get out more. Pippa had <a href="../images/Pals/pips-christening-0618-2.jpg">a fabulous christening</a> and <a href="../images/Pals/pips-christening-0618-1.jpg">Moss and Emily</a> looked very smart. We <a href="../images/Pals/thistledown-0618-2.jpg">went camping</a> for the first time this year <a href="../images/Pals/thistledown-0618-4.jpg">at Thistledown</a>. <a href="../images/Pals/thistledown-0618-1.jpg">The Sharpes joined in</a> and <a href="../images/Pals/thistledown-0618-5.jpg">Kerry and the girls</a> came up. Moss <a href="../images/Pals/thistledown-0618-3.jpg">loved every minute</a>! Sarah went up the hill with Sue and Nicky and <a href="../images/Pals/midsummer-0618.jpg">got all hippy chick</a> for the Summer Solstice.</p>

<p>Summer was in full swing now. We went for one of our regular trips <a href="../images/Family/fod-biking-0618.jpg">down to the Forest</a>. The kids finally worked out what <a href="../images/Family/airing-cupboard-0618.jpg">the airing cupboard</a> was for. The RAF <a href="../images/Family/raf-100-0718.jpg">got to be 100</a> and Sarah went on a brilliant bread making course at Shipton Mills - <a href="../images/Family/bread-0718.jpg">check this out!</a></p>

<p>We got to meet up with <a href="../images/Family/latest-cuz-0718.jpg">our other new cuz</a>, when Ayla came to visit. Moss had terrible chicken pox (he asked me not to post a picture), so they couldn't stay as planned. But we all met up at Crickley Hill which was nice.</p>

<p>I was making the most of <a href="../images/Family/garden-gate-0718.jpg">time with the kids</a>, as I was shortly to go <a href="../images/Family/surgery-0718.jpg">under the knife</a> to try and fix my right leg. These <a href="../images/Family/bullfinches-0718.jpg">little Bullfinch chicks</a> kept me company while I recuperated. Patrick and Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/go-ape-0818.jpg">a lovely time at Go Ape</a>.</p>


<p>Caroline stopped by on her way down to Spain. She had cleared out Clober Road and dropped off lots of little bits of family history. She had also come across these two great images from around 1970 - <a href="../images/Family/butlins-1970-1.jpg">one with our Dad</a> and <a href="../images/Family/butlins-1970-2.jpg">one with our Mum</a>. Lovely shots.</p>

<p>As Summer peaked, <a href="../images/Family/moss-is-three-0818.jpg">Moss turned three</a>.</p>
