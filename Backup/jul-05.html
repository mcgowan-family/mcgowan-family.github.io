<P>Live8 event is off and running and London has won the Olympic bid for 2012 - woo hoo! We were wondering if they'd do the MTB in the FoD!</P>

<P>Had a very cool weekend last week. Took Friday off (!!) Oxford by day and Wine Bar by night. Had the good sense to go and watch the Lions with Hoppy and Wats - what a good call that was! Japanese meals with Yan and Pingster, Tour de France kicked off, womens Wimble finals, bottles of wine on the terrace and massive <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_05.html">biking</A> in the FoD.</P>

<P>Took a fairly exciting fall in the FoD last weekend and bent the neck a little, but chiro will sort it. Note to self - do not wear dark glasses in forest. Had a great ride out on the Tuesday night session - new riders, <A HREF="../images/Biking/wistley-jul05.jpg">perfect weather</A> and great craic back in Morans.</P>

<P>Headed up to Skye last weekend. Weather wasn't quite as balmy as in Chelt, but had excellent time up in Corrie Ghrunnda and on Ridge with young Michael. Great views of <A HREF="../images/Climbing/eilan-donan.jpg">Eilean Donan</A> on way up, Glen Brittle campsite was perfect and midges weren't bad at all. Good experience of what early stages of hypothermia feels like, but 30 min's in the shower helped a lot. Audi wagon is perfect for these trips, but not sure how I'd get <A HREF="../images/Climbing/road-trip-05.jpg">all of this</A> into a couple of panniers.</P>


<P><A HREF="../biking/morzine-05.html">Morzine</A> was massive!. Biking was great and it was very cool to be back in <A HREF="../images/Biking/shepherd-chesery.jpg">the Alps</A>.</P>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
