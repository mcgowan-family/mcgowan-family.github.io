<P>As we mentioned last time, we were on the move. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/sold.jpg">The sale</a> eventually went through in April 2013 and we moved in during July.</P>

<p>We had a very enjoyable summer. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/picnic2-may-13.jpg">Lazy picnics</a> in the garden, getting <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/picnic1-may-13.jpg">the family</a> round, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/picnic3-may-13.jpg">getting friends round </a>and generally <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/picnic4-may-13.jpg">having fun</a>.</p>

<p>We did <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/garden1-may-13.jpg">some work</a> as well. But it was all about finding out about the Old Rectory and <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/wildlife1-may-13.jpg">who else</a> lived here. Turned out quite <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/wildlife2-may-13.jpg">a few others</a> lived here. In <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/wildlife3-may-13.jpg">all sorts</a> of shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Who needs <a href="../images/Family/family-bath-0413.jpg">a swimming pool</a>! Sometimes Godliness comes after cleanliness. We organised for Patrick and his classmates to get a bit of ecumenical broadening at <a href="../images/Pals/synagogue.jpg">the Cheltenham synagogue</a>.</p>

<p>Shortly after the sale, we headed off for <a href="../travel/stdavids-may-2013.html">our annual pilgrimage</a> to St.Davids.</p>

<p>When we moved in, the house wasn't in bad shape. It was a bit tired around the edges, but perfectly liveable. Here are some shots of what it looked like in July 2013:</p>

<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-1-0713.jpg">the garden</a>, a bit overgrown</li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-2-0713.jpg">the scullery</a>, at least it was once, but had since been converted into a bit of a dodgy bathroom</li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-3-0713.jpg">the garden room</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-4-0713.jpg">the dining room</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-5-0713.jpg">the kitchen</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-6-0713.jpg">the boiler room</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-7-0713.jpg">the lounge</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-8-0713.jpg">the hall</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-9-0713.jpg">the back bathroom</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-10-0713.jpg">the old Sunday Schoo</a>l, that would become Peter's bedroom</li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-11-0713.jpg">Patrick's bedroom</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-12-0713.jpg">Bryher's bedroom</a> - amazing colour scheme</li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-13-0713.jpg">the box room</a>, that would become the front bathroom</li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-14-0713.jpg">a guest bedroom</a>, with more interesting colour choices</li>
<li>and what would become <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-15-0713.jpg">our bedroom</a></li>

<p>Looking back it actually looks quite nice. Oh well, I'm sure it will again once we've finished :)</p>

<p>As the summer wore on, <a href="../images/Family/patrick-0713.jpg">the kids got feral</a>, we <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/garden-party-0713.jpg">all got relaxed</a>, I had <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/treehouse-0913.jpg">a great idea</a> and we went from no pets to <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/bees-0913.jpg">100 000 pets</a>.<p>


<p>Everything came to a very dramatic halt though, when Patrick managed to pull one of the old massive cast iron radiators off the wall. It happened in a part of the house we hadn't started work on, but a combination of old fittings and new enthusiasm riupped it off the wall. It threw him wide as it fell, and fortunately missed everyone else, but landed on his foot as it crashed to the ground. You wouldn't want to se a picture of the foot at the time, but <a href="../images/Family/baddy-1013.jpg">this was it </a>some time after a fabulous operation by the team from Frenchay that took place at Gloucester Royal. There was so much damage to the foot that the plan had been to do a skin graft, but a decision taken in the operating theatre went for a straight suture, which was a massive result.</p>

<p>There was a lot of <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-1013.jpg">family support </a>for our little wounded boy. And he didn't miss out on much - including <a href="../images/Family/bryher-is-4-1013.jpg">Bryher's 4th birthday party</a>!!! And when Ashwin had a birthday party in the woods, <a href="../images/Family/ash4-2-1013.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/ash4-1-1013.jpg">Bryher</a> came along to that too. No chance of losing Bryher in <a href="../images/Family/ash4-3-1013.jpg">this outfit</a>!</p>


<p>In some ways sorting stuff out for the kids seemed even more important now. This is <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/treehouse-1113.jpg">the treehouse</a> half way through in November. </p>

<p>Patrick's 6th birthday was a special event that he shared with Oli, and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-1-1213.jpg">all his other little mates</a> :)</p>

<li><a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-3-1213.jpg">Billy</a> was there</li>
<li>So was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-4-1213.jpg">Poppy</a>.</li>
<li>And of course <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-5-1213.jpg">Noah was there</a> for his big brother's party with Dad.</li>
<li>And <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-6-1213.jpg">Bryher was there</a> for her big brother.</li>
<li>And<a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-7-1213.jpg"> Hannah was there</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-8-1213.jpg">James</a> was there with Mum.</li>
<li>And everyone had <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-9-1213.jpg">a great time</a>.</li>

<p>Thanks to everyone for coming and thanks to Tracey and Sarah for all the organising and <a href="../images/Family/patrick-6thbirthday-2-1213.jpg">amazing food</a>.</p>

<p>So we started work on the house in earnest back in September last year. We took the front of the house apart and put it back together <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-1-1213.jpg">just in time for Christmas</a>.</p>


<p>It's still a bit rough in places in the front, but we're getting there.</p>

<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-2-1213.jpg">The hall</a></li>
<li><a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-3-1213.jpg">the dining room</a></li>
<li>We turned the old box room in the front, into <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-4-1213.jpg">a new bathroom</a></li>
<li>We started turning the crazy old bathroom downstairs in the back, into <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-5-1213.jpg">a scullery</a> again (ok, a utillity room)</li>
<li>Peter's bedroom<a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-6-1213.jpg"> is under way</a></li>
<li>But <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/in-progress-7-1213.jpg">the back bathroom</a> has a long way to go :)</li>

<p>But while the house has pretty much consumed us for the past 6 months., life goes on. And with a precocious 4 year old around, <a href="../images/Family/queen-b-0214.jpg">it's never dull</a>.</p>

<p>We popped down to @Bristol  in February. Always fun. <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol1-0214.jpg">Educational too</a>! I think <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol2-0214.jpg">Bryher's head</a> might be back at the Rectory. Dyson could learn <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol3-0214.jpg">a thing or two</a>.  Anything <a href="../images/Family/at-bristol4-0214.jpg">you can do</a> ...</p>

<p>All things have their season, and we've come through a tough one. All of us in one room for 3 months without heating, then moving back into the front of the house. Patrick's accident. Birthday's, Christmas, starting work on the back of the house. But as the days get longer and we can see the end of the major works inside the house, it feels like it's not just<a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/spring-flowers-0214.jpg"> the Spring flowers</a> that are shaking off the grip of Winter. </p>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
