<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Spring into Summer 09</H1>
</DIV>


<P>Patrick continues to be the first and last thing on our minds. He is mad as <A HREF="../images/Family/frogs.jpg">a box of frogs</A> and <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-bear.jpg">a wee blether to boot</A>, but <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-fossils.jpg">you've got to love him</A>.</P>

<P>As Spring turns into Summer, Sarah is really getting into <A HREF="../images/Family/sarah-gardens-09.jpg">her gardening</A>. Nice way to relax at the end of a busy day of work. We went and saw some slightly bigger gardens down in <A HREF="../travel/cornwall-2009.html">Cornwall</A> in the first week of <B>July</B>.</P>


<P><A HREF="../social/patrick-christening.html">Patrick was christened</A> towards the end of May. Afterwards we all went to Zizzi's and he did <A HREF="../images/Family/zizzis.jpg">impersonations of Granda McGowan</A>.</P>


<P>In <B>May</B> we headed down to London and had a lovely weekend with Toby, Rachel and <A HREF="../images/Pals/william-bluebells.jpg">William</A>. We checked out <A HREF="../images/Pals/borough-bones.jpg">Borough Market</A>, then the<A HREF="../images/Pals/patrick-tunnnel.jpg"> Lady Diana memorial kids park</A> in Kensington Gardens, which is fantastic! Popped into <A HREF="../images/Pals/V&A.jpg">the V&A</A> for a spot of paddling! And spent Sunday in Kew. It was stunning and <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-william-blubells.jpg">Patrick and William</A> were very cute.</P>

<P>We  popped out to Pembroke for a weekend by the sea. Found <A HREF="../images/Family/barafundle1.jpg">Barafundle beach</A>, which is an amazing spot. Patrick got his <A HREF="../images/Family/barafundle2.jpg">first taste of a seaside holiday</A> - won't be his last <A HREF="../images/Family/barafundle3.jpg">if his Mum</A> has anything to do with it. Headed out to Skomer and checked out <A HREF="../images/UK/puffins.jpg">the Puffins</A>.</P>

<P>In April, <A HREF="../images/Family/michael-patrick.jpg">Michael</A> came down for the HONC. I think this is maybe the first time <A HREF="../images/Family/HONC-09.jpg">the Gales</A> have ridden the HONC.</P>

<P>Over the <B>Easter week</B>, we took Patrick to the Cotswold Farm Park. <A HREF="../images/Family/easter1-09.jpg">He loved it</A>! We kind of enjoyed it too - <A HREF="../images/Family/easter2-09.jpg">Sarah in the petting zoo</A>! He'd never come across an Easter egg before, but he seemed to know what to do:</P>

<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/egg1.jpg">Very excited</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/egg2.jpg">I'll just have a bit</A></LI>
<LI>Maybe I should <A HREF="../images/Family/egg3.jpg">have the lot</A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="../images/Family/egg4.jpg">Uncle Brian</A> taught me everything I know</LI>


<P>Did a <A HREF="../images/Pals/burns-09.jpg">Burn's Supper</A> again this year. Turned into quite a big event. Which doesn't explain <A HREF="../images/Pals/jo-banjo.jpg">this behaviour</A>.</P>



<P>We got <A HREF="../skiing/vallorcine-09.html">our first ski trip</A> in to the <B>Chamonix Valley</B> later in Feb 2009.</P>


<P>Cheltenham got it's <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/big-snow-09.jpg">heaviest snow</A> since the 80's during Feb 09. I <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/paul-lekky-09.jpg">went skiing</A> with <A HREF="../images/Pals/snow-dudes.jpg">Dave and Jules</A> on Lekky. Then <A HREF="../images/Family/shab-09.jpg">sledging with Sarah</A> on Shab Hill. And finally decided to <A HREF="../images/Pals/got-it.jpg">saw down a tree</A> or two - as you do. The tree felling was legendary. I was at the base, <A HREF="../images/Pals/yeah-got-it.jpg">Dave had the rope</A>, it all went <A HREF="../images/Pals/what-the.jpg">a bit sideways</A>, but <A HREF="../images/Pals/fuck-was-that.jpg">worked out fine</A> in the end!</P>


<P>Fitzy did <A HREF="../images/Climbing/fitz-last-munro.jpg">his last Munro</A> in October 2008. A great day on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/beinn-eighe.jpg">Beinn Eighe</A>.</P>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
