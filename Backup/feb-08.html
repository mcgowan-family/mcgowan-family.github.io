<P>Been a while since last update. Back in last summer, it was still me and Sarah cutting about together. We headed out to West Wales in August and went to <A HREF="../images/UK/ramsay1-07.jpg">Ramsay Island</A> (saw the first seal pups of the year). For some reason Sarah decided to take me up <A HREF="../images/UK/crickley-07.jpg">Crickley Hill</A> and cook a barbeque - it was great :o) And Francis took us round to see his new house. Sure, <A HREF="../images/Pals/francis-house-07.jpg">it'll be great</A> and we'll be in by Christmas ;o)</P>

<P>Headed over to <A HREF="../travel/frigiliana-2007.html">Spain in October</A> and caught up with most of family. </P>

<P>For some reason had <A HREF="../images/Pals/pudding-party2-08.jpg">a pudding party</A>! <A HREF="../images/Pals/pudding-party1-08.jpg">Lots of friends</A> came along, and the winner was ....... <A HREF="../images/Pals/pudding-party3-08.jpg">New York cheesecake!</A></P>

<P>Leo threw a bonfire party and <A HREF="../images/Pals/steve-longhair.jpg">Steve let his hair down</A>.</P>

<P>Headed over to <A HREF="../travel/washington-2007.html">Washington</A> with work in November. Some folk hadn't done the DC tour, so we took in most of the sites.</P>

<P>December was a big month. <A HREF="../social/patrick-newborn.html">Patrick William </A>was born at 0947 on 11 December. He is <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-tintin.jpg">a great little man</A> and he's been very busy since he got here.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
