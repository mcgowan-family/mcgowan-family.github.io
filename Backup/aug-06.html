<P>The month started of with a quick trip up to Snowdon with <A HREF="../images/Climbing/raph-idwal.jpg">Raph</A> to get our climbing skills back up for Old Man of Stoer in September. We stayed in the bunkhouse at Capel Curig and climbed at <A HREF="../images/Climbing/raph-idwal2.jpg">Idwal Slabs</A> and Minas Mot in Llanberis. The climbing in Llanberis was followed by a bit of gratuitous skinny dipping in the Afon Nant Peris. Fortunately no images of this can be brought to you at this time. I finally got to Pete's Eats in Llanberis, which is definitely more famous for its history than its breakfasts :o)</P>


<P>Popped down to London for a great weekend at Toby's. As ever, London was a fabulous mix of unrelated images and highlights :o) The <A HREF="../images/UK/kensington-0806.jpg">London parks</A> were  parched. This <A HREF="../images/UK/covent1-0806.jpg">Rangers supporter</A> had just heard the Dunfermline score. <A HREF="../images/UK/tube-0806.jpg">These lads</A> were celebrating the fact that there would be another season of <I>Love Island</I>.  I was sleeping just up the road from 22 suspected terrorists in <A HREF="../images/UK/paddington-green.jpg">Paddington Green station</A>. The V&A was <A HREF="../images/UK/V&A-0806.jpg">the V&A</A>. And I finallly got to a show at The Globe (<I>Coriolanus</I> doncha know) which was fabulous, if <A HREF="../images/UK/globe-0806.jpg">a little damp</A>, in parts :o)</P>

<P>Finished of the month up in Scotland at <A HREF="../images/Family/geraldines-wedding2.jpg">Geraldine and Etienne's wedding</A>. More pic's <A HREF="../social/social.html">here</A>. <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_06.html">Got some biking in</A> as well at the <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-06-1.jpg">Pedal for Scotland</A> event, along with a number of other rides out with Michael (including the Wednesday night bash with the Glasgow MTB club). Great fun riding up and down the M6 with <A HREF="../images/Biking/nice-rack.jpg">a full rack</A>.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
