<P>We knew early in 2020 that the popular sense that Covid would be over in a  few months was going to be short-sighted. That said, I didn't expect to still be in the thick of it as 2021 was drawing to a close.</P>


<p>But again, we had much to be thankful for. No-one had actually had Covid19. We managed to get away for a couple of holidays in the UK and we did a load of camping over the summer, which was lovely.</p>

<p>I had had a good honey year in 2020, and 2021 was looking good even as early as January as the ladies were <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/bee-0221.jpg">out on the garden flowers</a>.</p>


<p><a href="../images/Family/sarahs-50-0221.jpg">A very special birthday</a> for Mum in Feb as she turned 50. Much to be thankful for as we reflected back on the previous couple of years when at times we might have wondered if she would have made it to this one! There was a less special birthday, but <a href="../images/Family/pauls-57-0421.jpg">still a lovely one </a>for Dad at 57 in April :)</p>

<p>This was to be a year of all three children moving to St.Edwards. We had had a really positive experience with Patrick in his first year and they did an exemplary job of home learning copmpared to Leckhampton Primary who were dreadful. <a href="../images/Family/patrick-ccf-0321.jpg">Patrick loved his CCF</a> at St.Edwards and even got something out of the ironing! Moss ahd a terrible time in home schooling at Leckhamptoni and we decided to bite the bullet and move him across. <a href="../images/Family/moss-day1-0421.jpg">He certainly looked the part</a> in his new school togs.</p>

<p>I had a hunch that the lockdown restrictions would ease around Easter, to allow society to start getting back to normal, so we booked a holiday for that week in a part of the world we'd never been to before - <a href="../travel/corfe-castle-apr-2021.html">the Purbecks</a>.</p>


<p>It was another lovely Spring. For years, I had been thinking about trying to track down the near mythical Pasque Flower.  It's a rare thing and, legend has it, will only grow on soil where Viking blood was spilled. I'm always a sucker for a good story, so we set off a few times looking for it at a site called Taylors Hill above Hillcot, It didn't show during April, but we finally came upon it at Barnsley Warren off the Fosse Way. Knowing it was now in season, we went back to Taylors Hill that weekend and found <a href="../images/wildlife/pasque-flower-0521.jpg">a wonderful little patch</a> on the hillside.</p>

<p>Every now and again, <a href="../images/Cheltenham/flying-scotsman-0621.jpg">the Flying Scotsman</a> sets off on a trip around the UK with a bunch of well-heeled passengers aboard. When it does, it occasionaly passes through Cheltenham. This happened in June this year and we, along with hundreds of others, piled onto a few of the key bridges that looked over the track as she passed below.</p>
