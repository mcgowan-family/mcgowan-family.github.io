<P>September didn't pan out as expected. Plan was for the Assynt Expedition in Second week, then off to Vietnam for next 2 weeks. First bit went as planned, but Dad died at end of that week so it all went a bit pear-shaped for a while.</P>

<P>I'll come back to Assynt in a minute, but there's no avoiding we were all pretty shook up by Dad's death. It's something to do with losing the whole generation. But no regrets and no complaints; his was <A HREF="../social/dad.html">a life well lived</A> and he left us all wanting more. Not a bad way to go.</P>

<P><A HREF="../travel/assynt-2006.html">The Assynt trip</A> was incredible. It has to be one of the more successful trips in terms of hitting the targets and just outrageous road trip big adventure fun.</P>

<P>I've lost the plot on October. The Challenger ball was cool. <A HREF="../images/Family/paul-shell-06.jpg">Shell came down</A>, we parted the night away at the Daffodil then ended up with Chris, Stu, Pia and the remnants of the band <A HREF="../images/Pals/chris-subtone-06.jpg">in SubTone</A>.</P>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
