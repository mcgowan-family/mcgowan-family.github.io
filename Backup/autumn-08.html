<P>Delighted to say that <A HREF="../social/wedding.html">we got married</A> on 22 August!</P>

<P>We went to <A HREF="../travel/paris08.html">Paris</A> on honeymoon.</P>

<P>And then in September we had <A HREF="../social/ceilidh.html">a ceilidh</A> to celebrate.</P>

<P>Came across a book called Wild Swimming. First stop was the <A HREF="../images/Pals/windrush.jpg">Windrush</A> beyond Burford.</P>

<P>Back in July, we headed over to <A HREF="../climbing/chamonix-08.html">Chamonix</A> for our annual pilgrimage to the mountains.</P>

<P>Patrick tried out swimming for the first time. Dips his toes in <A HREF="../images/Family/patricks-first-swim.jpg">the Cheltenham lido</A>, then goes all out in <A HREF="../images/Family/patricks-first-river.jpg">the Windrush</A>. Fortunately we had his tent with us to <A HREF="../images/Family/partick-king-of-mountain.jpg">warm down</A> in.</P>

<P>Patrick gets his first taste of <A HREF="../images/Family/patricks-first-music.jpg">playing a musical instrument</A></P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-sarah2.jpg">Patrick and Sarah</A> looking pretty happy about his new carry pack.</P>

<P>Check out <A HREF="../images/Family/going2.AVI">a quick video</A> of Patrick sitting up - and then falling down - for the first time, on Father's Day.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
