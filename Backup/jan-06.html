<P>Christmas was spent <A HREF="../images/Climbing/kingy-05.jpg">up North</A>.</P>

<P>Got some <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_05.html">biking</A> and <A HREF="../climbing/climbing05.html">climbing</A> in.</P>

<P>Jan has seen more biking on and off road. Bunch of us did the SPAM 55km across Salisbury Plain. For once I made a good call and decided not to take a camera which would never have survived the conditions. More mud and chain-suck than I've experienced before. A few good road runs around the Cotswolds. Starting to get the miles in for early Etape training.</P>

<P>Had a cool weekend down in London at <A HREF="../social/social.html">Toby's</A>.</P>

<P>Just getting ready for skiing in Meribel next week, ice climbing week after, then under the knife again to get dodgy knee sorted.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
