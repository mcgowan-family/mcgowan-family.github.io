<P>The Microsoft Challenger event has been the focus of the start of the month. The fantastic news is that WE WON IT!! Get all the news on <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">the Challenger page</A>.</P>

<P>Had a day off exercise after Challenger, then it was <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_05.html">back on the bike</A> :o)</P>

<P>Summer arrived with a vengeance and suddenly everyone's having parties. This one is round at Steve and Rose's place - <A HREF="../images/Pals/steves-BBQ-05.jpg">great garden</A>!</P>

<P>We've started <A HREF="../climbing/climbing05.html">training for the Alps</A>. We had the first practice session doing crevasse rescue up on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/self-rescue-3.jpg">Cleeve Hill</A>.</P>

<P>I've gone nuts over Lemon Jelly in past month - thanks Toby! Spacewalk is current favourite. So ok, objectively Star Wars was a bit crap ... but I still enjoyed it :o)</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
