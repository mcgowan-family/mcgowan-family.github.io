<P>Covid was finally something we were living with, rather than living under. Putin's war with Ukraine still raged on and it had sent us into an energy and associated financial crises. Among such unertainty, at times it was simpler to just keep it local.</P>


<p>With that in mind, I took the opportunity to shoot up to Crickley Hill and catch <a href="../images/Cheltenham/crickley-0123.jpeg">this wonderful temperature inversion</a>. Bryher was lucky enough <a href="../images/Family/crickley-bryher-0123.jpeg">to see it too</a>.</p>

<p>St.Edwards put on a really wonderful production of the Adams Family and Bryher had <a href="../images/Family/bryher-adams-family-0123.jpeg">some great scenes</a> in it :).</p>
    
    
<p>Sarah got to be another year older and baked herself <a href="../images/Family/sarahs-birthday-0223.jpeg">a lovely cake</a> for us all to enjoy :)</p>

    
<p>We did some brilliant <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pew-removals-0223.jpeg">father & son removals/a> in February, with me and Moss moving two pews from the back of the church, across the road and into our conservatory. We sold one to rasie some funds for teh church and the otehr is still in teh conservatory.</p>

<p>Due to Covid, we hadn't been skiing for a few years. This was to be Moss's <a href="../skiing/chamonix-23.html">first outing to Chamonix</a>, during the February half term, with me and Patrick</p>


<p>And while we were off skiing, the girls decided to <a href="../images/Family/bryher-decorating-0223.jpeg">decorate the kitchen</a>!!</p>

<p>This is <a href="../images/Family/world-book-day-0323.jpeg">World Book Day 2023</a>. I don't think we were going for a theme!</p>

<p>Sometimes, you don't need expensive binoculars to see the wildlife. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/fox-0323.jpeg">This cheeky young fox</a> was helping itself to the birdfood on the kitchen wondow and got a bit rigwelted</p>

<p>In April, I took my scaffolding skills to <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/scaffolding-0423-01.jpeg">a whole new level</a>. And happily survived it. This was part of repainting the side windows in Normandy Grey, rather than white, doing <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/scaffolding-0423-02.jpeg">some patch plastering</a> and  some restoration on the gutters, to replace the silicone with Alan's original suggestion of putty!</p>
    
<p>During April, Bryher had a very exciting and memorable <a href="../images/Family/bryher-in-paris-0423.jpeg">trip to Paris</a> with all her friends from school.Meanwhile, <a href="../images/Family/doe-food-prep-0423.jpeg">Patrick & Pierre were doing cookery</a> as part of their DoE Silver.</p>

<p>Later in April, we did a great couple of days resistivity survey down in the field behind the rectory, searching for the remains of Nourses Farm, or anything predating it. The locations of the buildings can be seen on <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/nourses-farm-0423.jpeg">this map overlay</a>, but sadly nothing significant emerged on the survey. We put this down to the heavily waterlogged ground conditions</p>


<p>During May, there was the small issue of the <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/coronation-crown-0523.jpeg">coronation of Charles III</a>. So of course there <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/coronation-tea-0523.jpeg">had to be cake</a>!</p>

<p>We were well into a lovely warm spring and that means <a href="../images/Camping/garden-camp-0523-01.jpeg">garden camping</a>! As dusk turned to night, we were joined by this <a href="../images/Camping/garden-camp-0523-02.jpeg">lovely little fella</a>.</p>

<p>As another part of Patrick's silver DoE, he was doing rock climbing training with me. We had started in the Warehouse to get the basics of roping up, climbing, top-rope belay, clippng runners and lead belay. As a stretch target, I had hoped that we might have done a multi-pitch outdoors. Snoozing Suzie at Symonds Yat is always a good multi pitch to start on. Patrick had done really well in the indoor training and he was <a href="../images/Climbing/doe-patrick-0523-01.jpeg">up for it</a>.</p> 

<p>Before trying the multi pitch, we did the Golden Fleece, the classic single pitch severe in the corner. This was Patrick's first outdoor climb and he was solid. He did really well on what was to be <a href="../images/Climbing/doe-patrick-0523-02.jpeg">his first abseil</a> as well! We then started up Snoozing Suzie. Patrick was brilliant on what is a massive step up in complexity, handling gear extraction, being safe on belay and belaying from a stance. This is him <a href="../images/Climbing/doe-patrick-0523-03.jpeg">coming up the second pitch</a> This is him <a href="../images/Climbing/doe-patrick-0523-04.jpeg">topping out</a>, with awesome views behind into the sunlit Wye Valley. And this is us <a href="../images/Climbing/doe-patrick-0523-05.jpeg">celebrating on top</a>. As I said at the time, I couldn't have imagined doing something so great, with someone who not that long before, I didn't even know I'd ever get to meet. This was a truly great day.</p>

<p>In June I got to take advantage of the gliding day that Sarah got for my birthday. <a href="../images/Family/gliding-0623.jpeg">I loved it</a>!! But sadly I doubt I'll be able to devote enough time to keep doing it.</p>

    
<p>In June I visited <a href="../images/Work/suly-0623.jpeg">this corner of the Middle East</a> for what I imagine will be the last time.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, Patrick's mates came round and <a href="../images/Family/dungeons-and-dragons-0623.jpeg">played D&D every Sunday</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>Late spring is always sports day. This is Mossy <a href="../images/Family/moss-sprint-0623-01.jpeg">lining up for the sprint</a>, finishing <a href="../images/Family/moss-sprint-0623-02.jpeg">in good style</a> and <a href="../images/Family/moss-sprint-0623-03.jpeg">picking up his medal</a>. Well done Moss!</p>
    
    
<p>Me and Moss had a lovely day together down at Slimbridge. We <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0723-01.jpeg">looked for snakes</a>, we <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0723-02.jpeg">found some ducklings</a>, we <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0723-03.jpeg">explored the swamp</a> and we  <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0723-04.jpeg">found an otter</a>. All in all, a pretty great day :)</p>
    
<p>The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) is still a thing for <a href="../images/Family/patrick-CCF-0723.jpeg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/bryher-CCF-0723.jpeg">Bryher</a>.</p>
    
    
<p>Metal detecting is still a big activity for Sarah. One of her nicer finds this summer was the <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/georgian-shoe-buckle-0723.jpeg">Georgian shoe buckle</a>. Given the date, it might have belonged to one of the Norwood family.</p>
    
<p>It <a href="../images/Family/head-to-head-0723.jpeg">had to happen</a> at some point. I don't suppose I'll be long.</p>
    
    
<p>Sarah snapped <a href="../images/wildlife/ladybird-0823.jpeg">this confiding ladybird</a> just after it llaid it's eggs on the bark of a beech tree.</p>
    
<p>During August, me and Moss took <a href="../travel/scotland-aug-2023.html">a road trip up to Scotland</a>.</p>    

<p>We all went for a lovely <a href="../travel/devon-aug-2023.html">couple of weeks in Devon</a> in August.</p>
    
<p>In early September, Sarah and Emily took the kids down to Barry Island for <a href="../images/Pals/charlton-pals-0923.jpeg">a lovely last day</a> in the sun and sea.</p>
    

<p>For a number of reasons, it had been a long time since we had been on a bike trip. During the summer, we came up with the intent to rectify that, with a 'bike packing' trip around the wilder parts of mid Wales. Bike packing is like an off-road version of cycle touring.</p>
    
    
<p><a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-1.jpeg">We set off</a> in early October and headed towards our departure point of Rhyader.From there we headed up the Elan valley to <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-2.jpeg">the resevoirs</a>. Upstream of the resevoirs, it is mainly <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-3.jpeg">river crossings</a>. We stopped off for lunch at the mythical <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-4.jpeg">Strata Florida</a>. I was riding an electric for the first time, which was fantastic, until it ran out of battery!! that was 10 miles before we reached the wonderful <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-5.jpeg">Ty'n Cornel hostel</a>. What a place!! </p>
    
    
<p>Day two was a bit rough. We didn't know that <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-6.jpeg">at this point</a>. <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-7.jpeg">This picture</a> is taken at SN 953 606. No bike was ever intended to go to this place. And yet despite this, <a href="../images/Biking/wales-1023-8.jpeg">these simple souls</a> appear to be happy with their effort.</p>
    
    
<p>Towards the end of October, Patrick was privileged to go on the year 11 school trip to Greece. Centred around Athens, each day was packed with activity. Day one was a trip to the wonderful site of Delphi, which turned out to be Patricks favourite. The next day took them to the Peleponnese, crossing the wonderful <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-1.jpeg">Corinth Canal</a>. This day woud be spent at Mycenae. They walked through the legendary <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-2.jpeg">Lion Gate</a> and visited one of the <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-3.jpeg"beehive tombs, also known as a <i>tholos</i> tomb. After passing through the <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-4.jpeg">vast entrance portal</a> with massive carved blocks, the interior is roofed with a <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-5.jpeg">false domed ceiling</a> constructed using corbelling. The last full day was spent around the Acropolis, visiting the famous Acropolis Museum and, of course, seeing <a href="../images/Greece-23/greece-23-6.jpeg">the Parthenon</a> - nice scaffold!</p>
    
<p>As Autumn grew old, we had <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1023-1.jpeg">a lovely Halloween</a>. I wonder if this will be <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1023-2.jpeg"></a>Bryher's last in costume, at least for 10 years! Whereas Moss and the girls have <a href="../images/Family/halloween-1023-3.jpeg">a few years left</a>.</p>
    

<p>Halloween turned quickly into <a href="../images/Family/guy-fawkes-1123.jpeg">Guy Fawkes night</a>. And Guy Fawkes night turned into <a href="../images/Family/armistice-1123.jpeg">Armistice Day</a>.</p>
