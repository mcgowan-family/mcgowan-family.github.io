<P>Well 2019 was behind us. It had been quite a year, and we were looking forward with hope to something a little more straightfoward in 2020. Be careful what you wish for.</P>


<p>But we had decided to finish 2019 and see in 2020 in Glasgow! We found a fabulous apartment on Botanic Crescent overlooking <a href="../images/Family/botanic-gardens-0120-03.jpg">the gardens</a>, and it was a great location. <a href="../images/Family/botanic-gardens-0120-04.jpg">Everyone loved it.</a> We spent a lot of time in the gardens and <a href="../images/Family/botanic-gardens-0120-02.jpg">Patrick got into photography</a>. This is <a href="../images/Family/botanic-gardens-0120-01.jpg">one of his</a>. Bryher did the <a href="../images/Family/bryher-high-ropes-glasgow-0120.jpg">high ropes at Braehead</a>!!</p>

<p>The apartment had a great view of the fireworks on Hogmanay and we even <a href="../images/Family/new-year-glasgow-0120.jpg">lit some up ourselves</a>.</p>


<p>On New Years Day we went out to Mugdock Park for some fresh air. The weather was pretty foul, but Patrick was really keen to see the castle, so we left the others in the warmth of the Land Rover and set off across the moor through the rain with Patrick  wearing a bin liner as a makeshift waterproof! The castle was nice to see again and tell Patrick all about it. As dusk fell, we headed down to the loch to have a look. I had my bins with me and lifted them up more out of tradition than any expectation of seeing anything. To my amazement - and slight anxiety due to the rubbish conditions and time of day - I saw what I was sure was a drake north american Ring-Necked Duck, associating with a drake Goldeneye, across the loch from us. I took a hopeless record shot and we hurried back to the car before dark. I sent the record into RareBirdAlert and the county recorder. The next day, someone went up and got <a href="../images/Birding/ring-necked-duck-010120.jpg">a great picture to confirm it</a>. It showed well for the next month. Dumbartonshire's first ever Ring-necked Duck!</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the day at Geraldine and Etienne's having a nice New Year's day dinner. Always lovely to see <a href="../images/Family/metiviers-0120-01.jpg">all the cousins together</a>. We finished off with <a href="../images/Family/metiviers-0120-02.jpg">lots of party games</a>. Those Metiviers play boggle far too often!</p>

<p>I  spent some time way down in <a href="../images/Work/port-stanley-0120-01.jpg">the South Atlantic</a> early in the year! It's liek <a href="../images/Work/port-stanley-0120-02.jpg">stepping back in time</a>. This is <a href="../images/Work/port-stanley-0120-03.jpg">the wreck of the Jhelum</a>. I was lucky enough to see a lot of <a href="../images/Work/berthas-beach-0120.jpg">amazing wildlife</a> like these Gentoo Pengions on Berthas Beach.!</p>

<p>We headed back to Chamonix for sking again this year, <a href="../skiing/chamonix-20.html">just Patrick and me though</a>, in the February half-term. Before we set off, word was beginning to emerge about an outbreak of a virus in South East China. While we were in Chamonix, it suddenly appeared just across the border in Bergamo. Little did we know it was going to colour so much of the rest of our year.</p>

<p> I took the kids down to the Forest of Dean for our annual pilgrimage <a href="../images/Family/fod-0120.jpg">around the Family Trail</a>. Sarah pushed the boat out for <a href="../images/Family/valentines-0220.jpg">Valentines Day</a> :) and this was <a href="../images/Family/world-book-day-0320.jpg">World Book Day 2020</a>!</p>


<p>Covid 19 was now established in the UK. And as March set in, we started settling in to what was to become a routine through the year of local day trips and garden parties. This was <a href="../images/Family/garden-chilli-0320.jpg">the first campfire chilli night in March</a>. Which was accompanied by some impromptu <a href="../images/Family/frog-spawn-0320.jpg">pond dipping for frog spawn</a>.</p>

<p>But despite Covid, the world still turned, and <a href="../images/Family/bee-0320.jpg">winter turned into spring</a>. I produced <a href="../images/Family/walks-0320.jpg">a set of walks</a> to keep folk busy during what came to be called 'lockdown'. We took advantage of an amazing spell of spring warmth to get <a href="../images/Family/moss-pixie-hole-0320.jpg">out on the hill</a>.</p>


<p>Early on in 'lockdown' before we got into a rythm I had more time on my hands and managed to <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/conservatory-0420.jpg">finish off the conservatory</a>! Moss <a href="../images/Family/moss-pedal-biking.m4v">learned to ride his new bike in April</a>, having only just mastered the balance bike early last year!</p>

<p>The weather <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/spring-0420.jpg">kept getting better</a>. Warm enough for <a href="../images/Family/kids-water-spray-0420.jpg">water games</a>. Warm enough to <a href="../images/Family/garden-camping-0420-01.jpg">get the van out</a> - but <a href="../images/Family/garden-camping-0420-02.jpg">only as far as the garden</a></p>

<p>The quiet roads of lockdown presented a perfect opportunity to get the kids out on the bikes. This is <a href="../images/Family/patrick-biking-0420.jpg">Patrick down at Witcombe Reservoir</a>. We gradually increased <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-biking-0520.jpg">the group and the distance</a>. <a href="../images/Family/nhs-flags-0520.jpg">Supporting the NHS</a> became a big thing. The weather had been so good, that for the first time, I had <a href="../images/Family/honey-extraction-0620.jpg">an early summer honey extraction</a> and as usual, <a href="../images/Family/honey-extraction-0620-02.jpeg">everyone got in on the act</a>. And we went for a walk in Lineover Woods to see the Silver-streaker Fritillaries and <a href="../images/Family/lineover-woods-0720.jpg">other wild creatures</a>. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/neowise-0720.JPG">Comet Neowise</a> put in a show to round off July</p>

<p>Travel restrictions meant that holidays would be local to the UK. We booked <a href="../travel/barmouth-aug-2020.html">a wonderful week in Barmouth</a> up in North Wales. It's an interesting place. The weather was wonderful and there is so much to see up there.</p>

<p>For the early August bank holiday, we had a few days at the Far Peak campsite near Northleach with the Sharpes and the Cartwrights. It was a great spot with <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-01.JPG">a great climbing wall</a>. <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-02.JPG">Everyone had a go</a>. <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-03.JPG">Patrick was climbing well</a>. <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-04.JPG">Bryher as graceful as ever</a>. We did <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-05.JPG">a bit of wild swimming</a> in the Windrush east of Burford. More climbing for <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-06.JPG">Moss on the boulder wall</a>. It all took its toll and <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-07.JPG">Moss is looking very tyred here</a>. But <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-08.JPG">soon back on the climbing wall</a>. We headed off to <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-09.JPG">Northleach Jail</a> for a nice lunch. Camping is <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-10.JPG">always great fun</a>. Just before we left we were treated to an amzing sight of <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-11.JPG">two air balloons setting up</a> and <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0820-12.JPG">lifting off</a> right in front of us.</p>

<p>Keepin up the day trip theme, it was <a href="../images/Family/thomas-land-0820-01.jpg">off to Thomas Land</a> for Moss's birthday. <a href="../images/Family/thomas-land-0820-02.jpg">He was ecstatic</a>. Back at the Rectory, it was <a href="../images/Family/moss-birthday-0820-01.jpg">time to cut the cake</a>. Sarah had arranged for <a href="../images/Family/moss-birthday-0820-02.jpg">an ice cream van</a> for a garden party!! There were the <a href="../images/Family/moss-birthday-0820-04.jpeg">traditional tractor rides</a>. I think I enjoy these <a href="../images//Family/moss-birthday-0820-05.jpeg">as much as the kids</a>. And <a href="../images/Family/moss-birthday-0820-06.jpeg">another cake</a> :) <a href="../images/Family/moss-birthday-0820-03.jpg">It went down very well</a> :)</p> 

<p>To give the kids more to do outdoors, I built a <a href="../images/Family/mud-kitchen-0820.jpg">'mud kitchen'</a>.</p>

<p>We had all planned to get off for a few days at Thistledown, but the poor old van broke down with a knackered gearbox. So I took the kids off in tents. Sarah wasn't so keen :) Love this shot of <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-01.jpg">Patrick and Bryher</a>. Moss even got <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-02.jpg">to sail his boat</a>. Thistledown was <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-03.jpg">as great as ever</a>. It changes every time <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-04.jpg">as the kids grow older</a>. They are <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-05.jpg">more of a little gang</a> now. <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0820-06.jpg">Nothing better than a campfire</a> :)</p>


<p>Something new this year, was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/on-air-0820.JPG">theatre at the Old Rectory</a>. A lovely lady called Fiona asked if we'd like to host an event to keep their theatrical show on the road. So we <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/on-air-0820-01.jpg">got the old canvas out</a> and <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/on-air-0820-02.jpg">invited some friends around</a>, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/on-air-0820-03.jpg">got everyone comfy</a> and <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/on-air-0820-04.jpg">put on the show</a>.  </p>

<p>We popped down to <a href="../images/Family/bristol-zoo-0820-01.jpg">Bristol Zoo</a> for the day. Patrick and Bryher tried out the <a href="../images/Family/bristol-zoo-0820-02.jpg">high ropes course</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Pals/emilys-five-0920.JPG">Emily was five</a> in September, so <a href="../images/Family/moss-poncho-0920.JPG">Moss dressed up</a>. Will was 50!! so <a href="../images/Pals/wills-50-1020.jpg">we all dressed up</a>.</p>

<p>The world turned and Summer turned into <a href="../images/Family/moss-autumn-1020.jpg">Autumn</a>. It had been on the cards for a long time, so we finally headed off to Somerset and <a href="../images/Family/wookey-hole-1020.jpg">Wookey Hole</a>. It was <a href="../images/Family/wookey-hole-1020-02.jpeg">masks on</a>, even in the caves!But there is more than caves to Somerset. We stayed in a lovely little hotel called the Hollies in Martock, then spent a great day at <a href="../images/Family/fleet-air-arm-1020.jpg">the Fleet Air Arm Museum</a> in Yeovilton. One positive aspect of Covid, is that all these destinations all year were far less busy than normal.</p>

<p>Another day trip, this time for Bryher's birthday - Harry Potter World! It was Bryher's birthday, but <a href="../images/Family/potter-world-1020-01.jpg">Moss was pretty happy too</a>. But Bryher was <a href="../images/Family/potter-world-1020-02.jpg">definitely in the driving seat</a>!</p>

<p>As Christmas hoved into view, we headed of to Sudely for <a href="../images/Pals/sudeley-lights-1220.jpg">a socially distanced light show</a> with the Sharpes. It was really well done and I'm sure we'll go again.</p>

<p>For Patrick's birthday, we made his day by taking him to the Tank Museum at Bovington Camp. This is him <a href="../images/Family/tank-world-1220.jpg">under the gun of a Challenger 2</a>!</p>

<p>The Christmas break finally arrived and I have to say we had a lovely 2 weeks just messing around locally. It all felt vey wholesome and restorative. We popped up to Crickley Hill on <a href="../images/Family/christmas-eve-1220.jpg">a chilly Christmas Eve</a>. <a href="../images/Family/hogmanay-1220.jpg">The kids stayed up</a> for the first time on Hogmanay. And there was even quite a bit of snow, with some <a href="../images/Family/notgrove-luge-1220.MOV">great sledging at Notgrove</a>!!!</p>

<p>So 2020 was over. There was a lot of commentary about how it was the worst of years. And clearly there has been a lot of suffering across the world due to the many effects of the virus - health, social and economic. For our family, the effects were minor compared to others, we were very lucky - mainly the travel restrictions. In fact in some ways, it brought us closer together as a family and a community. It certainly felt like we got the most we could out of 2020!</p>
