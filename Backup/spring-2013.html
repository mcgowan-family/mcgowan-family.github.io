<P>One of the big changes coming up, is that The McGowans are moving home agian. We had no plans to, but <a href="../images/Family/rectory-0912.jpg">a home I had always loved</a> came on the market and, amazingly, it looks like we move in next week!!!</P>

<p>I'm not sure what the occasion was, but <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-baking-0912.jpg">the kids love to <i>help</i></a>, when Mum gets in the kitchen.</P>

<p>Another year, <a href="../images/Family/patricks-five-2.jpg">another birthday</a>. This time with a <a href="../images/Family/patricks-five.jpg"><i>Star Wars</i></a> theme.</p>

<p>Christmas is just brilliaint with the kids, and who would miss <a href="../images/Family/patricks-nativity-2012.jpg">the school Nativity</a>. I'm not entirely sure how the pig fits into the feast of the King of the Jews, but probably best not to dwell on that.</p>

<p>Another tradition is making the cake, and <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-01.jpg">everyone wants to get involved</a> in that.</p>

<p>Finally, Christmas Day arrives. This year, it was <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-02.jpg">bikes all round</a>. Then there was <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-03.jpg">more cooking</a>. </p>

<p>Wee Michael and Geraldine were back from New Zealand, so we all trooped up to Glasgow to see them and the rest of the clan. Glasgow Council did a great job for families in <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-04.jpg">Georges Square</a>. Patrick loved <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-05.jpg">the carousel</a>. We ended up as the events <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-06.jpg">model family</a>, which was pretty funny. With pictures in the Glasgow Herald and look out for us in the run up to next years event! <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-07.jpg">Patrick and Bryher loved it all</a>. And of course we had the compulsory trip up to <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2012-08.jpg">Mugdock Park</a>.</p>

<p>It wasn't a bad winter and we even got some <a href="../images/Family/snow-13-01.jpg">decent snow</a>. <a href="../images/Family/snow-13-02.jpg">A great sledging trip</a> was marred a bit by the kids getting way too cold. Need to get more cold weather gear next time I'm in the US.</p>

<p>I was really pleased to get away <a href="../skiing/champoluc-13.html">skiing with Andrew and Hilary</a> mid March (12 thru 15). A real treat to spend time with friends in the mountains. Andrew and Hilary drove over and met Andrew's cousin Brian in his normal winter domicile of Champoluc. I flew out and met them later in the week.</p>


<p>We had a very early camping trip down to Watchet in March. <a href="../images/Family/watchet-0313.jpg">Imogen and the kids </a>came with us and we stayed in a caravan, but it was too cold really. Lesson learned for next year :)</p>

<p>Patrick has <a href="../images/Family/blue-class-bristol-0313.jpg">a great little bunch of mates</a> in reception blue class. And the Mums and Dads get on well too. This is Billy (and wee brother Sebastien), Ollie, Jakie and Freddie. Outside the Aquarium in Bristol.</p>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
