<P>After all the indoor climbing at the Warehouse, we finally got outside in <A HREF="../images/Climbing/st%20sundays%20feb05.jpg">the Lakes</A> (5/6). Conditions didn't support winter climbing, but we carried all the gear anyway for the weight training :o)</P>

<P><a href="../images/Pals/toby-spins.jpg">Toby</a> was a great host in London (12/13) and <A HREF="../images/Pals/fishers-tower.jpg">the Fisher's</A> had fun (despite the cold!!).</P>

<P>A flying visit to Glasgow by train (19/20), as I've trashed the Audi. Had a great morning's climbing with Michael at the indoor wall at Ibrox, Caroline and Maureen laid on a great meal for Mum & Dad's anniversary and birthday and <A HREF="../images/Pals/iains-40.jpg">Iain's big four-oh</A> at The Chip was a good chance to catch up with folk.</P>

<P>Rugby is wild annd wonderful with more teams able to snatch the wooden spoon than the grand slam!</P>

<P>Great biking all month culminating with some <A HREF="../images/Biking/mech3-mar1.jpg">wild night riding</A>.</P>

<P>Steffi & Jamie are now online and were able to send this great picture of <A HREF="../images/Family/Des&Jamie.jpg">Dezmond and Jamie</A> from Saltcoats in 2002.</P>

<P>This months top music looks like K.T. Tunstall's debut album.</P>

<P>cheers, McG.</P>
