<P>Been in USA for most of September. Been hiking & climbing in <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/merced.jpg">High Sierras</A> of California with Fitz for first half of month. Now in <A HREF="../images/USA/san-fran-tram.jpg">San Francisco</A> and heading over to East Coast tonite.</P>

<P>Spent first week in <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/yosemite.jpg">Yosemite</A>. Did some climbing and some great long hikes and back-country camping. Didnt see any bears, but just about everything else.</P>

<P>Drove round through Tuolumne Meadows and over Tioga Pass down into Owens Valley for second weeks climbing. Did <A HREF="../images/Whitney/whitney-first-light.jpg">Mount Whitney</A> and Mount Muir. Met some great folk and would have sumitted on Mount Russell had we not got snowed off.</P>

<P>Latter part of trip spent on <A HREF="../images/USA/big-sur.jpg">Pacific Coast</A>. Hit the coast around Morro Bay and drove up to SF, via Monterey. Spent last couple of days in <A HREF="../images/USA/gg-park-golf.jpg">San Fran</A> enjoying the hospitality of Paul and Eunice who were good enough to let us crash. Saw a wilder side of SF than previously!</P>

<P>Will spend next week working on East Coast  then back to UK.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
