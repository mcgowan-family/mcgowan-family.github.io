<P>Gerry came down for unexpected visit at start of month, so that was fun taking him round the locals. Even fitted some <A HREF="../images/Family/gerry-cricket.jpg">cricket</A> in!!</P>

<P>Final preps were put in place for <A HREF="../climbing/arolla-05.html">the Alps</A>. Of the many things that we thought would be likely to stop us achieving our goal, a last minute strike at Heathrow wasn't on the list. Fortunately we were able to resched in the wee small hours of Thursday night and everything went off largely to plan ;o)</P>

<P>Got out to <A HREF="../images/UK/worms-head.jpg">the Gower</A> for a great weekend. Weather was gorgeous and lots of <A HREF="../images/UK/bug.jpg">wildlife</A> about :o)</P>

<P>Spent a week up in <A HREF="../living_spaces/glasgow.html">Glasgow</A>. Got a lot of <A HREF="../images/Biking/pedal-for-scotland-05.jpg">biking</A> in, some climbing, planned next months High Sierra extravaganza with Paul, spent quality time with family and wandered round <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/horseshoe-bar.jpg">the old town</A> soaking up the atmosphere :o)</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
