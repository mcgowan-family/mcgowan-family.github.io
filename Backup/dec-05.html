<P>The run up to December had a lot of Challenger prep, including a training weekend on <A HREF="../images/Challenger/jb-airs.jpg">Dartmoor</A> where I turned an ankle. It also had a great weekend over in Oxford centred around a British Sea Power concert (brilliant!!).</P>

<P>December cracked off with the trip over to <A HREF="../travel/florida.html">Florida</A> to compete in <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">Challenger Worlds 2005</A>. We had all been taking the training <A HREF="../images/Challenger/steve-tapering.jpg">pretty seriously</A>, so it was good to have a few days before the event to see a bit of Florida and relax.</P>


<P>With Challenger out of the way, it's time to fix various broken body parts before the Winter Season gets properly underway. The Audi has packed in out of sympathy, so if you spot any German estates for sale, gimme a shout.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
