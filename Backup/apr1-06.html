<P>Well it's been a few weeks since last update and a lot has happened. Out of the blue, <A HREF="../social/mum.html">our Mum</A> died at the end of Feb. It was a shock to everyone, but the wheel turns and life goes on. One more star in heaven.</P>

<P>It's a no brainer, but we only have so long in this life, stuff like this just reinforces the message. So get your approach right. Love life and help other folk out. Always get your round in. And right here and right now is generally where the sweet spot is.</P>


<P>Last weekend was the Hell of the North Cotswolds, aka the <A HREF="http://www.cc-cc.co.uk/hotnc.asp">HONC</A>. This was my first major <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_06.html">biking</A> outing since the knee op. I seemed to know a hell of <A HREF="../images/Biking/honc-start-2006.jpg">a lot of folk</A> in it this year. I may be institutionalised.</P>

</P>Best recent movie is <A HREF="http://www.tsotsi.com/english/index.php">Tsotsi</A> and best tunes the latest <A HREF="http://www.belleandsebastian.com/">Belle & Sebastian</A> offering.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/photo_galleries/4857266.stm">Celtic win the league!!!</A></P>

<P>The next few weeks are taken up by some amazing adventures through the Alps. Me, steve and Leo are setting out to do the <A HREF="http://www.cosleyhouston.com/haute-route.htm">Haute Route</A> from Chamonix to Zermatt. We want to do it unguided, <B>because we can</B>!! Weather is likely to be the biggest hurdle, but all will be well.</P>
<P>cheers, Paul</P>
