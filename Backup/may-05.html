<P>The month started with a great weekend up in Glasgow. Picked up the <A HREF="../images/Biking/onone.jpg">Il Pompino</A> on the way up in Doncaster, had a new set of wheels made up out at <A HREF="../images/Biking/wheelcraft.jpg">Wheelcraft</A>, went climbing over at <A HREF="../images/Climbing/ash-pink.jpg">the Govan wall</A> and spent lots of time with the family.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-goes-postal.jpg">Training for Challenger</A> is a major focus at the moment. We had a great <A HREF="../pals/pals_05.html">training weekend</A> out in Wales.  Went down to the Forest biking again. I managed to wipe out on a jump by not following my own advice. No broken bones but snapped a number of bits off the bike. Some pic's from the Wye on <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">the new page</A>.</P>


<P>Michael was down mid-month as part of applying for PGCE course. Adrian convinced us that Moda would be good after <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cleeve-may05.jpg">climbing</A> on Wednesday - never again.</P>

<P><A HREF="../climbing/climbing05.html">Climbing in Peaks</A> was amazing, and hopefully get some in up North at end of month for Bank Holiday.</P>

<P>The world entered a new period of Darkness as Evil overcame Good at the end of the SPL season. It's the end of an era, but order will be restored before too long.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
