<P>Haven't had much time to blog of late. Was in Canada at start of month and got back to Montreal for the traditional mix of <A HREF="../images/Canada/montreal-cafe.jpg">Euro</A> and US culture. Gorgeous place with great mix of <A HREF="../images/Canada/montreal-signs.jpg">old</A>, <A HREF="../images/Canada/montreal-graffiti.jpg">new</A> and <A HREF="../images/Canada/montreal-limo.jpg">retro</A>.</P>

<P>Spent a week in <A HREF="../travel/sardinia.html">Sardinia</A> which is to be recommended - lots of scenery, sea, wildlife and <A HREF="../images/Sardinia/gargles.jpg">architecture</A>. Flew with easyjet into Olbia in the north-east. Stayed in the lovely old town of <A HREF="../images/Sardinia/alghero.jpg">Alghero</A>.</P>

<P>Ran the Stroud Half Marathon with Chris , Rachael and Ali towards the end of the month. On the same day, Garan, Andy and John were all running the full Venice Marathon. We all did pretty well in our class - but hats off to <A HREF="../images/Challenger/john-venice.jpg">the guys in Venice</A>.</P>


<P>The month has closed with the Challenger Charity Ball 2005. Very successful and raised all the cash for the Worlds which is cool. Legal reasons prevent me bringing you all the images, but you can now find a selection <A HREF="../Challenger/challenger.html">here</A> ;o)</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
