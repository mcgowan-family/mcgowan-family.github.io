<P>Spent a long weekend In Glasgow in November 2011, <a href="../images/Family/michaels-leaving.jpg">saying cheerio to Michael & Geraldine</a> as they headed off to New Zealand.</P>

<P>Stayed in the West End with Paul. Great day <a href="../images/Family/fitz-kids-1111.jpg">at the Transport  Museum</a> and <a href="../images/Pals/fitz-sue-1111.jpg">Byres Road</a>. Patrick's <a href="../images/Family/patrick-transport-museum-111.jpg">on top of the world</a>!</P>

<p>As Christmas approaches, <a href="../images/Family/bryher-new-coat-1211.jpg">Bryher looks festive</a> in Auntie Caroline's coat.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Biking/xmas-ride-2011.jpg">The Christmas bike ride</a> was a bigger affair than normal. Road bikes this year. Left from our place, but for reasons that ascape me now, left without me.</p>

<p>Sarah and I had a glitzy Hogmanay. <a href="../images/Family/new%20year%202012%201.jpg">Most of the glitz</a> was provided by Sarah. <a href="../images/Family/new%20year%202012%202.jpg">Bryher</a> and <a href="../images/Family/new%20year%202012%203.jpg">Patrick</a> got ready for the races on New Years Day. Grandpa thought he was going racing, but <a href="../images/Family/new%20year%202012%204.jpg">the grandkids had other plans</a>.</p>

<p>We finally got an annual pass to the Cotswold Wildlife Park. And now<a href="../images/Pals/wildlife%20park%200112%201.jpg"> we seem  to live there</a>. The Watt Clan came along <a href="../images/Pals/wildlife%20park%200112%202.jpg">for the ride</a>. And <a href="../images/Pals/wildlife%20park%200112%203.jpg">everyone had a great tim</a>e as usual.</p>

<p>If you ever want to get a reaction from a toddler, stick <a href="../images/Family/bryher%20sundae%200112.jpg">a big firework in a big ice cream</a>!</p>

<p>Sarah's birthday presented the opportunity for Patrick and bryher to help cook the cake. This consisted of <a href="../images/Family/sarahs%20birthday%200212%201.jpg">licking all the utensils clean</a> and then <a href="../images/Family/sarahs%20birthday%200212%202.jpg">the bowl</a>.</p>

<p>Some great weather in March gave us fun days for <a href="../images/Family/patrick-0312-01.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/bryher-0312-01.jpg">Bryher</a> in the garden, a trip to slimbridge to try <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0312-01.jpg">canoeing</a> for the first time and <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-01.jpg">a lovely Spring trip</a> to the Wildlife Park at Burford. Bryher looked cute <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-02.jpg">among the spring flowers</a>, <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-03.jpg">Patrick was never far away</a> and <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0312-04.jpg">you never know what you'll find</a> in that fountain.</p>

<p>We all headed down to Devon for what turned out to be a great week in <a href="../travel/devon-apr-2012.html">Bucks Mills</a>.</p>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
