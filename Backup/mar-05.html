<P>This month has been mainly about <A HREF="../travel/co_ut_2005.html">trip to US</A> and training for Challenger.</P>


<P>Training for the Challenger event is really kicking in and Saturdays and evenings are becoming absorbed by that.</P>

<P>Now got all the gear for ice climbing, but time is running out for actually getting any in.</P>

<P>Thirteen Senses debut album is worth a listen. Saw<I> A Very Long Engagement</I> on the plane which is worth a look.</P>

<P>Car still off road. Not missing it much, but will need it for Glasgow trips.</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
