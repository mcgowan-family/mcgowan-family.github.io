<P>Too long since the last update, but it's all to do with kids keeping us busy. So a lengthy recap and highlights and I'll try and get more regular updates on here.</P>

<P><a href="../climbing/lochaber-2010.html">A great trip up north </a>with Leo, Steve and Raph to Lochaber last February (2010). Tried it again this year, but with less success. That's Scottish winter weather for you.</P>

<P><a href="../images/Family/beardy-2010.jpg">Grew a beard</a> for the first time ever! Mixed reception.</P>

<p>We all went <a href="../skiing/vallorcine-10.html">skiing to Vallorcine</a> in the Chamonix Valley. This time, Fitz, Sue, Oli, Sophie, Jenny, Byron, Chris and Stu came along. A fantastic trip!</p>

<p>Patrick hadn't realised what was about to hit him yet, so he was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-montpellier.jpg">still having fun</a> in March 2010!</p>

<p>But Bryher was on her way and we got some great pic's of Bryher as <a href="../images/Family/snowball.jpg">a wee baby</a>. What <a href="../images/Family/wrap.jpg">a cutie</a>.</p>

<p>The next big thing that happened, was that we bought a VW Camper. It was something of an impulse eBay purchase. But it has all worked out well. It has taken us on many happy trips since we picked him up in May 2010. Our first outing was to <a href="../images/Family/camping-devon-0610%201.jpg">North Devon</a>. A great camp site that allowed <a href="../images/Family/patrick-devon-0610.jpg">camp fires</a>. Everyone <a href="../images/Family/camping-devon-0610%202.jpg">getting in on the act.</a> <a href="../images/Family/camping-devon-0610%203.jpg">Patrick enjoying the stream </a>at another campsite (Pool Bridge) just south of Lynton. There's something very satisfying about building <a href="../images/Family/camping-devon-0610%204.jpg">your own fire.</a></p>


<p>Dave's tenure at Lyneham was drawing to a close. We went down, with Will and Jo, to enjoy their last family day. Sarah was <a href="../images/Family/sarah-hercules-0610.jpg">VERY HAPPY</a> in the back of a Herc.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Family/bryhers-christening-02.jpg">Bryher's christening</a>, was a great chance to get everyone together. It was lovely to have <a href="../images/Family/bryhers-christening-01.jpg">loads of folk </a>down from Scotland again. I'm not sure when it started, but by July 2010, <a href="../images/Family/bryhers-christening-03.jpg">the big romance</a> was in full swing (as was Patrick's chicken pox). Proud God Mum shows off <a href="../images/Family/bryhers-christening-04.jpg">our beautiful girl</a>.</p>

<p>We went in search of shark's teeth on Selsey Bill in July 2010. No shark's teeth, but some dramatic shots of <a href="../images/Family/patrick-selsey-0711.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/bryher-selsey.jpg">Bryher</a> by a stormy Channel (and of course, Bryher now had chicken pox as well!).</p>

<p>It was time for the big summer holiday. A <a href="../travel/france-2010.html">camping adventure</a> to France!</p>

<p>An event that had been long in the offing, was the up coming wedding of Mr David Sharpe to Miss Julie Gray. As it happens, I would miss the actual event due to work :( but I made Dave's stag out in Herefordshire. Which was a smashing <a href="../images/Family/daves-stag-0810.jpg">two wheeled affair</a>. I also pulled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yINWeRg8PGg">a short movie </a>together after the event.</p>

<p>October saw another wedding, this time, the high society affair of October in Dublin, which was the wedding between Dave Asbridge (aka Stick Dave) and his muse Claire de Feu. Patrick and Bryher came with us and the whole thing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfjNLpxaPig">just brilliant</a>.</p>

<p>Bryher's first birthday was on the 27th of October 2010. We had a lovely party and I made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmtHJA5AEe0">a little movie</a> to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>The year was finished with a brilliant Winter bike ride with <a href="../images/Biking/whistley-1210.jpg">Dave & Jules and Will</a>.</p>

<p>The New Year began with a sporty outing to the Rec Centre to try out <a href="../images/Family/bryher-swims-0111.jpg">Bryher's new swimming cossie.</a></p>

<p>After a few abortive attempts due to wild & wintry weather, we finally got up North in January to <a href="../images/Family/scottish-christmas-0111.jpg">catch up with the family</a>.</p>

<p>We had made our now <a href="../climbing/lochaber-2011.html">annual pilgrimage up North</a> for a bit of Winter climbing fun in February, 2011. Big Dave came too. Mixed fortunes compared to last year's extravaganza, but many lessons learned as ever.</p>

<p>A lovely trip to<a href="../images/Family/puzzlewood-0211-1.jpg"> Puzzle Wood</a> down in the Forest of Dean. Very <a href="../images/Family/puzzlewood-0211-2.jpg">reminiscent of New Zealand</a>. Poor old van almost got stuck in the mud on the way out!</p>

<p>Patrick was beginning to get the hang of <a href="../images/Family/patrick%20scoots.jpg">his bike collection.</a></p>

<p>I had picked up Bryher a new tammie in Fort William and I thought she looked <a href="../images/Family/queen%20b.jpg">very bonny</a> in it :) <a href="../images/Family/bonnie-bryher.jpg">What a cutie</a>. April 2011.</p>

<p>We took the van down to Weston in April, which seems a bit brave looking back on it. Despite all the ice cream on offer, Bryher decided to <a href="../images/Family/bryher-weston-0411.jpg">eat  the beach</a> instead.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Family/bryher-bounces-0411.jpg">Bryher bounced into Spring</a> on Sue's trampoline. April, 2011.</p>

<p>We get down to Slimbridge whenever we can. Both Patrick and Bryher love it. And <a href="../images/Family/patrick-spider.jpg">it isn't all about the birds</a>.</p>

<p>Easter 2011, was great fun. <a href="../images/Family/easter-11.jpg">Another year, another garden Egg Hunt.</a> Alex and Gess came over too.</p>

<p>We had a short break up in the Lake District in May 2011. A really lovely trip. Stayed in a slightly odd little village called Haverigg down on the coast. Took lots of little train rides and went out on <a href="../images/Family/coniston-0511.jpg">Coniston Water</a> on the steamer. Every picture has Patrick pulling a face now.</p>

<p>We went to <a href="../travel/frigilliana-2011.html">Frigilliana</a> later in May for a week. What a treat!</p>


<p>We went  to see the Gifford Circus at Little Rissington with <a href="../images/Pals/gifford-0711-01.jpg">Graeme and Marie Therese and the kids</a>. It was brilliant! <a href="../images/Pals/gifford-0711-02.jpg">War & Peace</a> done through the medium of circus. Very funky. We'll definitely be going next year.</p>

<p>The van is such a part of what we do now. We headed down to a really nice local camp site near Stroud called Thistledown. Very eco-friendly. As ever, <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0711-01.jpg">we had a fire</a> :) But mostly, <a href="../images/Family/thistledown-0711-02.jpg">we just mucked about </a>:)</p>

<p>Michael and Geraldine will be heading out to New Zealand at the end of the year. As an early nod to that, we had <a href="../travel/north-wales-2011.html">a bit of a lads weekend</a> in North Wales. </p>

<p>We rounded off our Summer in 2011, with a great couple of weeks travelling up to and around <a href="../travel/west-highlands-2011.html">the West Highlands</a> in the van.</p>

<p>Patrick was a big three year old now.  I wanted to make sure we didn't forget <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSeHqFbOtts">the journey so far</a>.</p>

<p>Autumn was really nice this year, with lots of little day trips in good weather. This was at <a href="../images/Family/cotswold-wildlife-0811-01.jpg">the Cotswold Wildlife Park</a> where Patrick got <a href="../images/Family/cotswold-wildlife-0811-02.jpg">up close to the wildlife.</a></p>

<p>There was just time to get the <a href="../images/Family/soakaway1.jpg">crazy big DIY jobs</a> done before the weather turned. <a href="../images/Family/soakaway2.jpg">Bryher helped a lot</a>.</p>

<p>October had an amazing spell of warm weather, so it was back to Slimbridge and <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-01.jpg">Welly Boot Land</a>! <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-02.jpg">Look how strong I am!</a> <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-03.jpg">All happy smiles</a> for once. This was <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-04.jpg">Bryher's first exposure to the water fountain</a>. <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-1011-05.jpg">She seems to have a gift for it</a>.</p>

<p>And then <a href="../images/Family/bryhers2-01.jpg">Bryher was 2</a>. <a href="../images/Family/bryhers2-02.jpg">All that cake</a> helped make up for being another year older.</p>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
