<P>We knew early in 2020 that the popular sense that Covid would be over in a  few months was going to be short-sighted. That said, I didn't expect to still be in the thick of it as 2021 was drawing to a close.</P>


<p>But again, we had much to be thankful for. No-one had actually had Covid19. We managed to get away for a couple of holidays in the UK and we did a load of camping over the summer, which was lovely.</p>

<p>I had had a good honey year in 2020, and 2021 was looking good even as early as January as the ladies were <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/bee-0221.jpg">out on the garden flowers</a>.</p>


<p><a href="../images/Family/sarahs-50-0221.jpg">A very special birthday</a> for Mum in Feb as she turned 50. Much to be thankful for as we reflected back on the previous couple of years when at times we might have wondered if she would have made it to this one! There was a less special birthday, but <a href="../images/Family/pauls-57-0421.jpg">still a lovely one </a>for Dad at 57 in April :)</p>

<p>This was to be a year of all three children moving to St.Edwards. We had had a really positive experience with Patrick in his first year and they did an exemplary job of home learning copmpared to Leckhampton Primary who were dreadful. <a href="../images/Family/patrick-ccf-0321.jpg">Patrick loved his CCF</a> at St.Edwards and even got something out of the ironing! Moss ahd a terrible time in home schooling at Leckhamptoni and we decided to bite the bullet and move him across. <a href="../images/Family/moss-day1-0421.jpg">He certainly looked the part</a> in his new school togs.</p>

<p>I had a hunch that the lockdown restrictions would ease around Easter, to allow society to start getting back to normal, so we booked a holiday for that week in a part of the world we'd never been to before - <a href="../travel/corfe-castle-apr-2021.html">the Purbecks</a>.</p>


<p>It was another lovely Spring. For years, I had been thinking about trying to track down the near mythical Pasque Flower.  It's a rare thing and, legend has it, will only grow on soil where Viking blood was spilled. I'm always a sucker for a good story, so we set off a few times looking for it at a site called Taylors Hill above Hillcot, It didn't show during April, but we finally came upon it at Barnsley Warren off the Fosse Way. Knowing it was now in season, we went back to Taylors Hill that weekend and found <a href="../images/wildlife/pasque-flower-0521.jpg">a wonderful little patch</a> on the hillside.</p>

<p>Every now and again, <a href="../images/Cheltenham/flying-scotsman-0621.jpg">the Flying Scotsman</a> sets off on a trip around the UK with a bunch of well-heeled passengers aboard. When it does, it occasionaly passes through Cheltenham. This happened in June this year and we, along with hundreds of others, piled onto a few of the key bridges that looked over the track as she passed below.</p>




    <p>In June we headed up to Far Peak for our first camp trip. It's a great destination for <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0621-01.jpeg">climbing with the kids</a>. There are <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0621-02.jpeg">indoor areas</a> and <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0621-05.jpeg">Bryher and Moss</a> were looking good.There are <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0621-04.jpeg"> outdoor areas</a> and <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0621-03.jpeg">Dave and Pip</a> were enjoying those. There is a pretty epic tower, and <a href="../images/Family/far-peak-0621-06.jpeg">Moss got further up it</a>, than I thought he might!</p>

<p>And when we couldn't leave the garden, then we <a href="../images/Family/garden-camp-0721.jpeg">camped in the garden</a>!</p>

<p>And in July, Maggie was <a href="../images/Pals/maggies-50-0721.jpeg">a significant year older</a> :)</p>

<p>As the summer holidays kicked off, it was time for staycation day trips. Sarah had wanted to go to the Pitt Rivers for many years and today was the day! Of course Sars-CoV-2 was ever present, this time in the form of Angela Palmer's, <a href="../images/Family/pitt-rivers-0721-01.jpeg"><i>The Sphere that Changed the World</i></a>.So many <a href="../images/Family/pitt-rivers-0721-02.jpeg">things to see</a>! Pitt Rivers was the site of <a href="../images/Family//pitt-rivers-0721-03.jpeg">the Great Debate</a> where Huxley defended Darwin against Society. I loved this <a href="../images/Family/pitt-rivers-0721-04.jpeg">group of cetaceans</a> surfing in long distant waves.</p> 

<p>While conditions allowed, I led <a href="../images/Local%2520History/walk1-0821.jpeg">a local history walk</a>. And then it was time for <a href="../images/Family/moss-6-0821-01.jpeg">Moss's birthday</a>! As <a href="../images/Family/moss-6-0821-02.jpeg">a HUGE treat</a> we took Mossy <a href="../images/Family/moss-6-0821-03.jpeg">to LegoLand</a>. It was <a href="../images/Family/moss-6-0821-04.jpeg">a busy couple of days</a> and everyone had <a href="../images/Family/moss-6-0821-05.jpeg">a lovely time</a>.</p>

<p>Summer trundled on and I reconnected this old <a href="../images/Family/bryher-moss-roller-0821.jpeg">Dennis roller seat</a> to the mower for a laugh.We had a few other lovely days out, including <a href="../images/Family/bryher-moss-paddling-0921.jpeg">this one to Slimbridge</a>. And then it was time to go back to school, but for the fist time ever, <a href="../images/Family/patrick-bryher-moss-first-day-0921.jpeg">all in the same school</a>!</p>


    <p>Due to Covid, we didn't get away for a long summer holiday, but we had been away at Easter and we decided to go away again at the half-term break in October. Sarah found a wonderful place to stay in furthest west Wales, <a href="../travel/angle-oct-2021.html">the Rocket Cart House in Angle</a>. It was a historic old place, having been the coast guard look out, and the home of the rescue teams who would launch breeches buoys by rocket to rescue sailors wrecked on the rocks around the headland.</p>
    
<p>Bryher was another year older. A sure sign of turning 12 is more of an interest <a href="../images/Family/bryher-hair-1021.jpeg">in her hair</a>! But not too old to have <a href="../images/Family/bryher-12-1021.jpeg">a lovely cake </a>:)</p>
    
    <p>The latest Bond movie finally made the big screen after 2 years of delayed release due to Covid. We decided to have a family movie night in and got <a href="../images/Family/dressed-for-a-kill-1121.jpeg">dressed up for the event</a>. The shark doesn't look convinced, but he got into the swingof things in the end.</p>
    
    
    <p>Meanwhile, Moss was showing his different sides. One minute <a href="../images/Family/moss-overalls-1021.jpeg">the farm labourer</a>, the next, the <a href="../images//Family/moss-joseph-1221.jpeg">aspiring lead actor</a> in this years production of <a href="../images//Family/nativity-cast-1221.jpeg">the nativity</a>!</p>
    
    <p>The kids broke up for Christmas and we had another day trip planned - this time <a href="../travel/london-dec-2021.html">back to London</a>.</p>
    
    
    <p>And that took us up <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-01.jpeg">to Christmas eve</a>! We got <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-02.jpeg">the old fire</a> going in the dining room, I knocked up <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-03.jpeg">a new Christmas accessory</a> and <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-04.jpeg">the crib</a> was ready :)</p>
    
    <p>Christmas was a little different this year, as Grandma wasn't spending it with us. So the focus was <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-05.jpeg">all on the kids</a>. Another change was seafood rather than turkey - <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-06.jpeg">what a spread</a>! Everyone seemed to <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-07.jpeg">enjoy the change</a>, even <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-08.jpeg">Moss</a>! Sarah had made <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-09.jpeg">very fetching hats</a> for us all :) And then <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-10.jpeg">Christmas was over</a>, for another year.</p>
    
    
    <p>We popped down to Clearwell Caves in between Christmas and New Year. It was <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1221-11.jpeg">as charming as ever</a>.</p>
    
    <p>On Hogmanay, we drove down to Longleat, which had been postponed from Patrick's birthday due to him havig Covid. It's an odd experience watching another animal <a href="../images//Family/longleat-1221-01.jpeg">eat your car</a>, but we <a href="../images/Family/longleat-1221-02.jpeg">reconciled our differences</a> in the end. It's a lovely park and <a href="../images/Family/longleat-1221-03.jpeg">I'm sure we'll go back on another day</a> :)</p>
