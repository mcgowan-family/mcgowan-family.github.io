<P>The big news since the last update has been the arrival of <A HREF="../images/Family/bryer-1209.jpg">Bryher</A> into the family. More on that later.</P>

<P>Knowing that Bryher was on the way, we wanted to make sure that Patrick had a few special days to remember when it was just us and him:</P>

<LI>We spent the day at <A HREF="../images/Family/bristol-zoo-0909.jpg">Bristol Zoo</A>. Cracking fun, we'll do that again.</LI>
<LI>We went to Weston where Patrick had his first<A HREF="../images/Family/weston-0909-1.jpg"> Knickerbocker Glory</A> and <A HREF="../images/Family/weston-0909-2.jpg">looked cool</A> on the beach</LI>
<LI>And we went to Slimbridge for the first time and found <A HREF="../images/Family/slimbridge-1009.jpg">WellyBoot Land</A>!</LI>


<P>Sarah's brother <A HREF="../images/Family/rob-n-jax.jpg">Rob got married to Jackie</A> in October. Patrick was <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-rj-wedding1.jpg">well turned out</A> and <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-rj-wedding3.jpg">popped up in a few  shots</A>. This is <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-rj-wedding2.jpg">his first suit</A>. <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-rj-wedding4.jpg">Freya looked after him</A> all day. And <A HREF="../images/Family/wedding-1009.jpg">we had a very nice time</A> as well :o)</P>


<P>And then at the end of October, at 1636 on the 27th, <A HREF="../images/Family/bryher-1hour.jpg">baby Bryher</A> weighed in at 11 lb 1 oz. Very healthy :o) <A HREF="../images/Family/bryher-sarah-day1.jpg">Mother and baby</A> were very well. Dad was <A HREF="../images/Family/bryher-paul-day2.jpg">taking it all in</A>.</P>

<P>Auntie Caroline <A HREF="../images/Family/auntie-caroline.jpg">got her arms round the posse</A> a week later.</P>

<P>Patrick took a wee while to get used to not being the centre of everything. We went for a nice walk up <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-woodland-1109.jpg">Timbercombe Lane</A> and took him down to Magic Land in Cirencester where he <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-gunner-1109.jpg">got the hang of the cannons</A> pretty quick. And then it was time for <A HREF="../images/Family/patricks-2nd-birthday.jpg">his 2nd Birthday</A>!</P>

<P>Pretty soon it was Christmas. Someone was <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-christmas-eve-09.jpg">very curious on Christmas Eve</A>. And by the time the big day arrived, he was <A HREF="../images/Family/patrick-christmas-09.jpg">just blown away</A>.</P>




<P>cheers, Paul</P>
