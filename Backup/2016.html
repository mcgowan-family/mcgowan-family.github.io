<p>It looks like 2016 will be another good year for getting on with the Rectory. We finally seleected a landscaper to work with on the west terrace - Duncan Forrester - thoroughly good bloke. But as he decided he needed a mini-digger to finish levelling the site, I decided we should start into the wildlife pond - two birds with one stone. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-1-jan-16.jpg">Bryher was on the scene</a> of the crime in no time, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-2-jan-16.jpg">Patrick wasn't far behind</a>, Sarah came in <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-3-jan-16.jpg">to keep the first two </a>under control. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-4-jan-16.jpg">Who let her get on that</a>?!?!? We made<a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-5-jan-16.jpg"> a great job </a>of the hole. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-6-jan-16.jpg">A very big lorry</a> turned up to get rid of the spoil. And <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-7-jan-16.jpg">Steve and Nancy</a> helped us get the liner in.</p>


<p>But what about that terrace. Well, this is what it looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/ramp-summer-13.jpg">back in 2013</a> when we moved in. Then this is what it looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/terrace-1-jan-16.jpg">in January</a>. And <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/west-terrace-apr-16.jpg">this is what it looks like now</a> :) But having Duncan around was too good a chance to miss, so I sourced some <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/bigger-trailer-jan-16.jpg">amazing llimestone flags</a> from the site of the 12th century Studley Priory and we set about installing them outside the kitchen window <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/east-terrace-apr-16.jpg">to catch the morning sun</a>.</p>

<p>In parallel with the pond and the terraces, we were having a lot of internal decoration down. Andrew Bush had come on site and was busily transforming first the dining room and then the hall. This is what the dining room looked like <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/moving-in-4-0713.jpg">when we moved in</a>, and <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/dining-room-apr-16.jpg">this is what it looks like now</a> :) He's only started into the hall, so more on that later.</p>

<p>I almost forgot, we also had David Ruther on site, building <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/walnut-cupboard-apr-16.jpg">some fantastic cupboards</a> in two of the main bedrooms to match the originals in Bryher and Patricks rooms. That's a heck of a lot of work for a few months.</p>

<p>As Feb came around, Moss was starting to look <a href="../images/Family/moss-jeans-jan-16.jpg">more grown up all the time</a>, but he still knew <a href="../images/Family/bros-feb-16.jpg">who his big brother was</a>. And we all went out for <a href="../images/Family/yo-sushi-feb-16.jpg">our first ever sushi</a>!! And the pond was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/pond-1-feb-16.jpg">now full</a>!!</p>


<p>Patrick and me were lucky enough to get off for <a href="../skiing/aosta-16.html">a weeks skiing at half term.</a> The girls stayed home with Moss this year, and <a href="../images/Family/mums-coping-feb-16.jpg">it all went swimmingly.</a></p>


<p>I got back from Italy and headed straight to Scotland the next morning for the <a href="../social/chris-ash-wedding.html">first of this years big two weddings</a>. </p>

<p>March came around and Patrick was <a href="../images/Family/patrick-pirate-mar-16.jpg">a very effective pirate</a> in the school play, we had another trip to <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-mar-16.jpg">the wildlife park</a>, the kids sported some <a href="../images/Family/hats-mar-16.jpg">gorgeous headgear</a> cousin Shell had made for them and then on St.Patrick's night, sarah and me <a href="../images/Family/date-night-mar-16.jpg">actually got to go out</a> !!!!! Not finished yet, but <a href="../images/Family/dezmonds-bench-mar-16.jpg">Dezmond's bench </a>is coming along nicely.  <a href="../images/Family/pond-pals-mar-16.jpg">Treehouse bud's</a>. Moss is starting to <a href="../images/Family/three-on-a-swing-apr-16.jpg">join in the fun </a>with the other two.</p>


<p>The big event in March was our <a href="../travel/scillies-2016.html">fantastic Easter trip to the Isles of Scillies</a>!!!</p>


<p><a href="../images/Family/pauls-birthday-apr-16.jpg">Another lovely birthday cake</a> with the kids on the new terrace.</p>


<P>In what has become the norm with a camping trip. But Easter was early and <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0416-1.jpg">it was cold!</a> So it was all about <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0416-2.jpg">keeping the fire going</a>, <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0416-3.jpg">keeping active</a> and making sure Moss didn't get too cold. He seems <a href="../images/Camping/thistledown-0416-4.jpg">happy enough</a> though.</P>


<p>It soon started to warm up , and back at the Rectory, some <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/spider-0516.jpg">pretty big critters</a> started to appear! Someone <a href="../images/Family/moss-0516.jpg">slept right through</a> it. With warmer days, the canoes were open at Slimbridge, so we <a href="../images/Family/slimbridge-0516-1.jpg">went for an explore</a>.</p>

<p>Other things tend to happen in Springtime as well. Giffards comes to town, so <a href="../images/Family/giffards-0516-3.jpg">with great excitement,</a> it was off to see <a href="../images/Family/giffards-0516-1.jpg">Tweedy</a> and all <a href="../images/Family/giffards-0516-2.jpg">the rest of the show</a>.</p>

<p>And as the weather warms, we get up in the treehouse for our first night of the year. Patrick's still <a href="../images/Family/treehouse-0516-1.jpg">fast asleep</a> and Bryher has the <a href="../images/Family/treehouse-0516-2.jpg">best bed hair</a> ever. Moss sensibly <a href="../images/Family/moss-0616-1.jpg">stayed indoors</a>. And <a href="../images/Family/bryher-0616-1.jpg">Bryher went wild</a> at the Prestbury street fair.</p>

<p>Summer was just around the corner and it was time for the science fair. As ever, <a href="../images/Family/science-fest-0616-1.jpg">lots of experiments</a> to try, this one <a href="../images/Family/science-fest-0616-2.jpg">was quite cool</a>. I wonder if <a href="../images/Family/science-fest-0616-3.jpg">Patrick</a> and <a href="../images/Family/science-fest-0616-4.jpg">Bryher</a> will ever go to space for real??</p>

<p>There was a pretty extreme weather event in June when a lot of rain came down in a hurry. I didn't spot it at first, but the drains blocked round the back and before we knew it, <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/flood-0616-1.jpg">the sheds had flooded</a>. The water was <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/flood-0616-2.jpg">knee deep</a> and everything below that level got trashed. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/flood-0616-3.jpg">Church Road </a>was awash, but despite <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/flood-0616-4.jpg">this view of Dan's van</a>, none of the houses on that side got flooded.</p>

<p>Not sure <a href="../images/Family/pots-and-pans-0616.jpg">what Sarah made of this</a>. But it seemed <a href="../images/Family/tea-party-0616.jpg">to end well</a>.</p>

<p>I had a week on a course in London. Stayed just opposite <a href="../images/UK/london-0616-1.jpg">Tower Bridge</a> and <a href="../images/UK/london-0616-2.jpg">took the ferry</a> to work.</p>

<p>We made the most of the good weather and had a family day in <a href="../images/Biking/fod-0616-1.jpg">the Forest of Dean</a> again. Everyone <a href="../images/Biking/fod-0616-2.jpg">seems to be enjoying it</a> :) Fitzy came down for a few days and, for the first time in many a year, <a href="../images/Climbing/symonds-yat-0716-1.jpg">we all went climbing</a>!This is <a href="../images/Climbing/symonds-yat-0716-2.jpg">Andrew</a> and this is <a href="../images/Climbing/symonds-yat-0716-3.jpg">me</a>. And we went with Dave and Jules to <a href="../images/Family/fairford-0716.jpg">the Fairford Air Show</a>. Moss continued to be <a href="../images/Family/moss-0716.jpg">very cute</a>.</p>

<p>Summer was upon us now and it was <a href="../images/Family/lido-0716-1.jpg">time for the lido</a>. This was <a href="../images/Family/lido-0716-2.jpg">a first for Moss</a>. And <a href="../images/Family/honey-0716.jpg">summer means honey</a>!</p>


<p>There had already been one special wedding this year. Now it was time for <a href="../social/rob-shell-wedding.html">Rob and Shell</a> to tie the knot.</p>

<p>We had one night back in Cheltenham, then it was off again, this time on what would be our first major overseas trip as a family - <a href="../travel/greece-2016.html">to Greece</a>!</p>

<p>Always an important event, <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-birthday-1-0816.jpg">celebrating the first year</a>. Moss was one! Sarah made yet <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-birthday-2-0816.jpg">another amazing cake</a> and everyone <a href="../images/Family/moss-first-birthday-3-0816.jpg">had a great time</a> scoffing it.</p>

<p>Moss was keen to make friends with Emily - once he realised she had <a href="../images/Family/moss-and-emily-0816.jpg">a great new tent</a>! Then suddenly those long summer holidays were over and it was<a href="../images/Family/back-to-school-0916.jpg"> back to school</a>!</p>

<p>Work on the house is never done. I finally got around to rebuilding the fireplace to level up the pediment and improve the draw. <a href="../images/Old%20Rectory/first-fire-0916.jpg">The end result</a> was great to see. In another house, Steve had been planing a tree house for a while and  it was great to be able <a href="../images/Pals/pierini-tree-house-0916.jpg">to help put it together</a>.</p>

<p>Summer was drawing to a close, but there was still <a href="../images/Family/welly-boot-0916.jpg">lots of outside fun</a>. This was our <a href="../images/Family/wildlife-park-0916.jpg">last trip to the widlflife park </a>for the summer. Moss on <a href="../images/Family/moss-beach-1016.jpg">the pond beach</a>.</p>

<p>And on a lovely Autumn day, we finally got to go to <a href="../images/Family/westonbirt-1-1016.jpg">Westonbirt Arboretum</a>. <a href="../images/Family/westonbirt-2-1016.jpg">The colours</a> were stunning.  There was some <a href="../images/Family/westonbirt-3-1016.jpg">early walking</a> from Moss.  Our <a href="../images/Family/westonbirt-4-1016.jpg">three little cubs</a> in the woods. It was <a href="../images/Family/westonbirt-5-1016.jpg">a lovely family day out</a>.</p>

<p>Another important family birthday. This time <a href="../images/Family/bryhers-7-2-1016.jpg">Bryher was 7</a>! We had a little party in the Wilson Museum, which was a great choice. Lovely staff <a href="../images/Family/bryhers-7-1016.jpg">to help with crafts</a> and a puzzle tour round the museum for the kids.</p>

<p>At October half term, it was <a href="../images/Family/shaldon-1-1016.jpg">back to Shaldon</a> for our last trip of the year. Was this <a href="../images/Family/shaldon-2-1016.jpg">Moss's first encounter</a> with a British beach? Round on <a href="../images/Family/shaldon-3-1016.jpg">the Ness</a>. Sarah still <a href="../images/Family/shaldon-4-1016.jpg">loves Shaldon</a> :)</p>

<p><a href="../images/Family/pumpkins-1016.jpg">Halloween</a> was quickly followed by another horror show when <a href="../images/Family/moss-gets-trumped-1116.jpg">Trump was elected</a> as the 45th President. <a href="../images/Family/moss-nan-1116.jpg">Last night's nan bread</a> allowed Moss to recover his composure.</p>

<p>I took the kids down to <a href="../images/Family/bristol-1-1116.jpg">@Bristol</a>. Patrick pulled off the amazing <a href="../images/Family/bristol-2-1116.jpg">3 bubbles in 1</a> trick! Grandma turned 80 and Rob and Jackie arranged '<a href="../images/Family/grandmas-80-1116.jpg">a surprise party</a>'! Sarah took the kids up to<a href="../images/Family/horses-grave-1116.jpg"> the Horses Grave </a>while I was off in London. It took ages, but I finally restored the old block trolley that Caroline had got for Patrick. <a href="../images/Family/moss-wheels-1116.jpg">Moss loves it!</a></p>

<p>Paul Wilkinson, the local priest, had retired the year before and we had been waiting for his replacement, Gary Grady, to arrive before <a href="../images/Family/moss-christening-1-1116.jpg">getting Moss christened</a>. We're not in any sense big into religion, but I'm glad we waited for Gary. It was a lovely day. Moss was christened with water from the River Jordan. And as Gary said, just for that one second, he was the world's newest Christian. Sarah had asked Gaynor to <a href="../images/Family/moss-christening-2-1116.jpg">make a cake</a>. And everyone came back to the rectory <a href="../images/Family/moss-christening-3-1116.jpg">to enjoy some</a>.</p>

<p>And then it was December. <a href="../images/Family/patricks-9-2-1216.jpg">Patrick was 9</a>! He had a joint birthday with Finn and we went to laser tag over in Gloucester with <a href="../images/Family/patricks-9-1-1216.jpg">all the boys</a>. We went for <a href="../images/Family/london-1-1216.jpg">a day out in London</a>. It was nice for me to be able to take everyone round <a href="../images/Family/london-2-1216.jpg">the usual spots</a>. This is <a href="../images/Family/london-3-1216.jpg">a funky shot,</a> and just outside Palmer Street. We even got to the Natural History Museum and Moss ended up <a href="../images/Family/london-4-1216.jpg">as an exhibit!</a> And when we all got back, Sarah made <a href="../images/Family/patricks-cake-1216.jpg">another great cake</a>!</p>

<p>As the year drew to a close, it was time to <a href="../images/Pals/rose-wreath-1216.jpg">get ready for Christmas</a>. The big day came and we got to enjoy the <a href="../images/Family/christmas-1-1216.jpg">newly restored dining room</a>. The kids got to play with <a href="../images/Family/christmas-2-1216.jpg">all their new toys</a>. Unexpectedly, Patrick got to go on his <a href="../images/Family/christmas-3-1216.jpg">first twitch</a> for a Blue Rock Thrush in Stow! And we all went for <a href="../images/Family/christmas-4-1216.jpg">a lovely winter's walk</a> through the meadow, while we still could.</p>
