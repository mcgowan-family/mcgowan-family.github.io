<P>Went sailing off round <A HREF="../travel/majorca-2006.html">Majorca</A> in October. Nice trip and great company.</P>

<P>Had a great day at the races for the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Power_Gold_Cup">Paddy Power event</A>. Didn't exactly come out up, but it's all about the taking part apparently. Yeah rght :o)</P>

<P>Passed my motorbike test. <A HREF="../images/Family/paul-triumpant.jpg">Woohoo</A>!</P>

<P>Kayaked down the Wye from Symond's Yat to Tintern with Steve and Raph. Used a borrowed play boat. Definitely not the thing to do 26 km in. I was wearing an assortment of climbing and surfing gear - <A HREF="../images/Pals/raph-paul-wye.jpg">hence the daft helmet</A>.</P>

<P>Had a great weekend up in <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/uni-tower.jpg">Glasgow</A>. Intro'd Sarah to <A HREF="../images/Family/paul-moors.jpg">Milngavie</A>, Glasgow and all the folks.</P>

<P>Popped over to Germany to bring back <A HREF="../images/Family/paul-triumpant.jpg">Dezmond's Thunderbird</A>. Jamie was <A HREF="../images/Family/sarah-jamie1.jpg">a riot on his bike</A>, he's got some great skills and I expect big things. I look forward to taking him out when I'm not <A HREF="../images/Family/paul-jamie1.jpg">giving him a backie</A>!</P>

<P>Have been doing lots of biking and a bit of climbing. But no pic's :o)</P>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
