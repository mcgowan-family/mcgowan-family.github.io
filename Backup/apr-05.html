<P>The month started with a wild weekend led off by Steve Nev's 40th!! Everyone ended up back at the flat and there was an unexpected opportunity to go for a spin in a very nice Porsche convertible. </P>

<P>All the ice has gone from Scotland, so that will need to wait till next year. There are plans for a July attempt on something big in the Alps, but we'll see how that plays out.</P>

<P>We did a fancy dress pub crawl for Challenger - fortunately no pictures. I recommend to anyone the benefits of investing in a good DJ. And I would like to personally thank the NSPCC for a great night out.</P>

<P>As usual, the <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-05-cleeve.jpg">Hell of the North Cotswolds</A> was this month. We had <A HREF="../images/Biking/HONC-05-faff.jpg">a bigger group</A> than normal involved and everyone had a fantastic day out. Oli did particularly well by grabbing a top 20 place (out of a 1000 starters).</P>

<P>Down to London for the weekend with Toby. Brick lane for The Big Chill and curry, St.John's Wood cruising, the marathon and Tate Modern.</P>

<P>Among the normal Tuesday night and weekend bike runs, we arranged an outing for <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod2.jpg">the Challenger crew</A> in the FoD.</P>

<P>Doves' <I>Some Cities</I> is getting most play time at the moment. Finallly saw <I> Amelie</I> and <I>Sweet Sixteen</I>. Well worth the wait.</P>

<P>Lots more training for Challenger! </P>

<P>Car back on the road! Glasgow at the end of the month will be the test.</P>


<P>cheers, Paul</P>
