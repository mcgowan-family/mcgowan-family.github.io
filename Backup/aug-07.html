<P>Late May and it was time to get back to <A HREF="../travel/scillies-2007.html">the Scillies</A> for a weeks relaxing with Sarah. Been lots of biking and climbing of late, so was great to just chill for a week.</P>

<P>Time for the main biking event of the year. The <A HREF="../biking/fondo-07.html">Gran Fondo Campagnolo</A> 2007.</P>

<P>We had a another <A HREF="../images/Pals/june07-party.jpg">summer party</A> at the flat. <A HREF="../images/Pals/june07-party2.jpg">Who needs</A> a reason.</P>

<P>Some people are soooo irresponsible. Don't <A HREF="../images/Motorbiking/sarahs-reflection.jpg">try this</A> at home.</P>

<P><A HREF="../biking/tour-de-france-07.html">The Tour de France </A>came to London on 7 July.</P>

<P>A team of five of us drove down to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-aiguilles.jpg">the Alps</A> in late July for some climbing in <A HREF="../climbing/chamonix-07.html">the Chamonix Valley</A>.</P>

<P>While we were mucking about in Chamonix, the torrential rain of the Great British summer led to a water crisis in Gloucestershire, as the water system became contaminated. Me and <A HREF="../images/Family/sarah-gower.jpg">Sarah</A> took the chance to <A HREF="../images/UK/worms-head2.jpg">get away from it all</A> for a weekend down in <A HREF="../images/UK/rhossilli.jpg">the Gower</A>. </P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Pals/steve-jas-wedding.jpg">Steve and Jasmine</A> got married on the 3rd of August!!</P>

<P>Confirmed the addition of <A HREF="../images/Family/baby4.jpg">a new member</A> of the clan.</P>

<P>And finaly figured out <A HREF="../images/Pals/raphstock3-3.jpg">how to get rid</A> of the telesales people. This was at <A HREF="../images/Pals/raphstock3-1.jpg">Raphstock</A>, which was rated as maybe <A HREF="../images/Pals/raphstock3-2.jpg">best ever</A>! </P>

<P>Nice shot of <A HREF="../images/Family/sarah-bump.jpg">Sarah</A> at 6 months</P>

<P>cheers, Paul</P>
