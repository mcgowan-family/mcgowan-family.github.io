Family web blog 

This blog starts in 2003 as I leave the US after working there for the previous 4 years, through a number of significant world events.

Return to the UK is followed by a number of significant family and life events.

Through all of this, there are lots of travels and a lot of biking, climbing and skiing!

In 2006, the greatest of these transitions involves meeting Sarah and starting our family in 2007 as Patrick arrives.

The rest of the blog relates to our family as it grows together.
