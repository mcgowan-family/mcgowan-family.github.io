<P>Building on the success of the previous year, we decided to put <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-1-0314.jpg">Andrew's uphill skiing</a> to the test again, this time in Chamonix.</P>

<P>We started off with a route I'd done previously. This involved getting up to the top of the Flegere system, then <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-2-0314.jpg">climbing up to the Col Des Crochues</a>. It's a great climb and <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-3-0314.jpg">a great view when you get there</a>. I'm convinced <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-4-0314.jpg">Andrew enjoyed it</a>.</P>

<P>From Col des Crochues, we skied down of the north side of the Aiguilles Rouge, then <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-5-0314.jpg">skinned up to the Col de Brerard</a>. The climb was well worth it, as the snow in <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-6-0314.jpg">the Combe de Balme</a> was pretty good.</P>

<P>We knocked around a few ideas for day 2, but ended up sticking to the original plan, which was to head up to Le Tour and aim for the itinerary that drops off the east side and takes you down into Switzerland. this is <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-7-0314.jpg">looking back west to Mont Blanc</a>, just before the drop in. Getting ready to head of <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-8-0314.jpg">the east side of the Grand Aubannes</a>. And then some of <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-9-0314.jpg">the best powder ever</a> on the run down to Trient. We put in <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-10-0314.jpg">some good turns</a>. And <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-11-0314.jpg">we felt pretty pleased</a> with ourselves. But for every high <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-12-0314.jpg">there is a low</a>! But <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-13-0314.jpg">it all worked out very nicely</a> in the end.</P>

<P>We had always talked about doing the Valle Blanche and this was to be our chance. I'd done a number of lines down the valley and reckoned that the Grand Envers was the best, but the guy we were staying with reckoned that the Vallee Noir was worth a look. the name should have given us a clue really.</P>

<P>We took the cable car <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-14-0314.jpg">up to the Midi</a>. The weather was good, with good views over to <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-15-0314.jpg">the Dent du Geant</a> which was where our line lay.</P>

<P>We skied down into the valley, then skinned up to the Hellbronner. We skied past the Combe de la Vierge (which had lovely powder - I know!!) and <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-16-0314.jpg">skinned on up</a> to the Dent du Geant. <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-17-0314.jpg">The views from the top of the Noir</a> were fantastic.</P>

<P>We dropped into the Noir and it got a little sketchy. Steep, hard packed crust, crevasses and no obvious skiable line. I dropped down a little further and just when I thought we'd have to climb back out, I saw a line through the crevasses. We skied the line and came through to <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-18-0314.jpg">slightly easier ground below</a>. In retrospect, it was OK. You wouldn't have wanted to take a fall, but it was the poor conditions that added the objective danger more than anything else.</P>

<p>So we finally got to ski the Valle Blanche together. The Grand Envers would have been a better option for quality of skiing, but the Noir was certainly memorable :) <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-19-0314.jpg">Looking back up</a>, it was a day neither of us would forget any time soon.</p>
