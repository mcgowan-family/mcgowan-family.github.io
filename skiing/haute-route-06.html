<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Haute Route, April 2006</H1>
</DIV>

<P>The idea to try the Haute Route in winter as a ski-mountaineering expedition came about at the end of last year's trip to <A HREF="../climbing/arolla-05.html">Arolla</A>. While we were there climbing, some folk were walking the Haute Route in summer and I'd heard about the winter traverse as one of the big randonee challenges, so it seemed a great idea. When we asked the question "So what'll we do next year?", the Haute Route seemed the obvious answer.</P>

<P>Fast forward 8 months and me, Steve and Leo are out on the terrace realising how much we've forgotten about crevasse rescue. Everything starts to be about weight and how long we'll have to climb and ski with it. How many carabiners to take, do we take overtrousers, how many pairs of boxers!!! The recommendation from Peter Cliff's book is to take no more than 12 kg. Me and Steve were over that by a couple of kg, Leo was right about the mark.</P>


<P>An interesting point is that we had decided to do the route unguided. This was the natural choice for us, as we felt we had the skills and strength to do it. We were clearly in the minority and we would find most parties over the next week travelling with guides.</P>


<P>Two weeks later and we're standing outside the Gite Belvedere in Argentiere. We decided to do a shakedown day in the Vallee Blanche. This is the world's longest ski run at 25 kilometres. It's all off piste and it would be a great test of our skills, while still giving us a chance to buy/change any necessary gear in Chamonix.</P>

<P>The Vallee Blanche day <B>was</B> epic. We left the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-midi.jpg">
Midi</A> station (3842 metres) at around 0900 and skied down onto the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-steve-tacul.jpg">Glacier du Geant</A>. Rather than just ski the Vallee, we had agreed to try and ski over the Pointe Helbronner and down into Italy as well, coming back up in the Courmayeur cable car to finish down the Vallee into Chamonix. It was always going to be challenging, especially as the Midi cable car timings meant that the snow would be soft on the south facing Italian side by the time we got there.</P>

<P>It was obvious from the start, that the large packs would make skiing and climbing a challenge, compared to normal lift-served backcountry. Any mistake was amplified and we all adopted a fairly defensive approach on the icy slopes. </P>

<P>We climbed strongly up to Pointe Helbronner (by 1130) and discussed the pros and cons of dropping onto the Italian face. At this point, I'm delighted to say that we live in a blame free culture and that no-one (that's you guys) are going to point any fingers at any enthusiastic team members for confidently saying "That'll go". To be fair, there was some good snow as we dropped down the Glacier de Toule towards Courmayeur, but the weather quickly closed to the point where it was like skiing in a milk bottle and the snow deteriorated to something like bottomless porridge. Around this point, we developed one of the trip mottos, "Where's Leo?". The answer was generally to be found <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-leo-lounging.jpg">lounging in the sun</A> topping up his tan. </P>

<P>We finally made it to the Pavilion station above Courmayeur. Steve and Leo decided to head direct to Chamonix via road. The shakedown day had proven it's use, their gear was seriously in need of changing and they needed to get back to Chamonix pronto to do that as the day was drawing to a close. I decided that I probably had enough hours to get up to the top at Helbronner and make the descent down the Vallee to Chamonix on skis.</P>

<P> As I stepped out onto the summit, it was obvious that the crowds of the morning had gone. In fact, everyone had gone. I quickly dropped back down onto the Geant Glacier. It was great to be the only person in such a vast space. Looking <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-vallee-blanche-3.jpg">up the glacier</A> - no one, looking <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-vallee-blanche-2.jpg">down the glacier</A> - no one. It took an hour and a half to ski from Helbronner to the top of the train line to Chamonix, through some of the most <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-vallee-blanche-1.jpg">amazing scenery</A>. I had, of course, forgotten all about having to pay for the train. I gave the girl on the desk my, "I'm stupid, please help me" smile and she was good enough to cut the ticket price in half so that I could afford to avoid the long walk. <A HREF="http://www.cosleyhouston.com/alp-ski/hr-d2d/hr-day1.htm">Map of our route</A> on the Cosley-Houston site.</P>

<P>Back in the valley, Leo and Steve had made all the changes to their gear and we were ready for the off the next morning. While hanging around one of the gear shops, we bumped into a guy from Utah who would be doing the Haute Route with the guided Cosley-Houston party. This was a real coincidence, as we had used their <A HREF="http://www.cosleyhouston.com/home.htm">excellent web site</A> to come up with many of our plans. They were setting off tomorrow like us and would be following the same route.</P>

<P>There are a number of variants to the Haute Route and we had decided on the <A HREF="http://www.cosleyhouston.com/haute-route.htm">Classic</A>, as that seemed the right place to start. We headed up the Grands Montets lift to 3295. The day was fabulous and the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-steve-leo-start.jpg">views over towards the Drus</A>, Aiguille du Midi and Mont Blanc were exhillerating. Before setting off, we looked over towards the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-chardonnet-1.jpg">Col du Chardonett</A>  that we would climb to in a few hours. We set off around 10 and headed down onto <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-argentiere.jpg">the Glacier d'Argentiere</A>. The snow was firm at first, then powder and just as I was starting to get into the swing of it, hard crust, which led to a high speed face plant from yours truly. I pulled my nose out of the snow to see Steve and Leo disapearing off down the glacier towards the start of the first climb.</P>

<P>The climb up to the Col du Chardonnet is the first and one of the biggest on the route. Starting around 2700, it climbs steeply up to over 3300 meters. The steepness of the climb requires the normal skins, but also <A HREF="https://cosleyhouston.com/equipment-lists/haute-route-eq-list.htm">ski crampons</A> - what the Germans call harscheisen and the French, couteaux. </P>

<P>The rest of the first day involved a steep down climb on the east side of the col, nipping across the top of the Glacier de Saliena, climbing up through the Fenetre de Saleina and then on to the excellent Trient hut around 3200 meters.</P>

<P>We were <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-trient-1.jpg">seriously pleased</A> to get to the Trient Hut. The gear was all working well and we were feeling well worked. I had a number of aches from the day before having overdone it a bit in the Vallee Blanche. The toes of both feet were a bit of a mess and the operated on knee was starting to creak a bit. But <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-trient-2.jpg">the views were great</A> and two litres of wine later, everything seemed fine and we settled down to a few hours sleep before tomorrow's adventure.</P>

<P>The second day is the easy day of the 6 day approach to the Classic Route. Descend the Trient Glacier, nip over a col and whip down the Val d'Arpette into Champex for lunch and a transit to Bourg St.Pierre. We managed to find some fairly steep, hard pack to start the day, which tested our skills with the packs, but we were soon nipping down the Val d'Arpette. Once again, the snow conditions changed rapidly as we descended into warmer climes. Hardpack, turned to spring snow, turned to porridge and we were soon falling about in deep mush. We finally made it out to the road, just in time to see our bus disappearing off to Orsieres. With a couple of hours to kill, we settled into the excellent Relais au Club Alpin and made the best of it.</P>

<P>Our accommodation at <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-bourg.jpg">Bourg</A> was excellent and meant a good nights sleep after the typically noisy Cabane du Trient. The Auberges Au Petit Velan was simple but well put together and we enjoyed a great meal and recce'd the route for the next day.</P>

<P>The next morning, we set off around 7 and began our <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valsorey-2.jpg">long ascent</A> to the Valsorey Hut. Bourg is at 1630 meters and Valsorey at 3030 meters. The 1400 meter climb took us 7 hours! The initial section of the climb is on foot, carrying pack and skis. The snow became climbable around 2200 meters. The first obstacle is <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valsorey-1.jpg">a narrow gorge</A>. There was just enough snow in the gorge for us to climb it. Towards the top, I took an awkward fall, which twisted the dodgy knee. This was to be an issue for the rest of the trip and the regular sight from this point on, was <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valsorey-5.jpg">me  icing i</A>t once we reached each hut.</P>

<P>Every trip should have a competition. Worst crapper, was the nominated category and Valsorey probably wins it for <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valsorey-3.jpg">this bad boy</A>.  I kinda liked Valsorey. Despite the dodgy loos, the fact that they lost our booking so Leo and Steve ended up in the attic and the fact that the hut just isn't big enough; it's got a real 'out there' feel to it. We also met the excellent Austrian party of five (Marta, Florian, Lawrenz, Norbert and Gerhard - sorry if I got the spellings wrong!!) who introduced us to the card game UNO! It became a theme of the trip as we now shadowed each other over the next few days and nights. Alpine skiing often involves early starts and getting to the hut early - before the snow has softened too much. So afternoons are filled with idle chat, <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valsorey-4.jpg">games of backgammon</A> and mending broken ski and body parts.</P>


<P>The third day is described as the crux of the classic route. You climb from the hut up the steep face of the Grand Combin and cross onto the Plateau do Couloir at 3660 meters. As was always the case, the weather was going to be critical for such a high crossing point. The weather deteriorated <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-plateau-couloir.jpg">as we climbed towards the plateau</A> and by the time we reached it, it was blowing a gale and a complete whiteout. We had taken the precaution of entering GPS waypoints and we used these to navigate across the plateau to the Col Sonadon. The Cosley-Houston party were moving near us, but invisible in the cloud. Mark had been good enough to say that we could follow their tracks if need be. We should have noted the advice, as we missed the critical traverse at 3300 meters and found ourselves at the top of a massive icefall. Stepping gingerly back up, we made the traverse and got back onto firmer ground. Some fabulous spring conditions followed on the Mont Durand glacier and we made our way down into the Grande Chermotane basin, before climbing up to <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-chanrion.jpg">the Chanrion Hut</A>.</P>

<P>To get from Chanrion to Vignette, we had decided to follow another Cosley-Houston tip and climb the Portons, through to the summit of Pigne d'Arolla. This had the benefits of avoiding the boring slog up the Otemma Glacier and the tricky seracs on the Brenay. All went well until we got slightly higher on the mountain than expected, cutting over the shoulder of the peak above Col Nord des Portons, rather than the col itself. But it did result in a nice powder run down the other side, once we'd sorted it out.</P>

<P>This turned into a tiring day. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-austrians.jpg">The Austrians</A> were climbing strongly and were soon out of sight as the once clear day began to deteriorate into white out. By the time we reached the high point at 3772 meters, I had bonked and getting down was number one on the list. Our early start paid off and the snow conditions turned out to be excellent high up on the mountain. We now enjoyed the best powder of the trip as we bounced down the face towards the Vignette. Again the weather played a hand. Conditions deteriorated and everyone on the mountain found themselves struggling  to find the narrow route through the ice fall. Being unguided, we played safe and descended down to where we knew we could safely cross over towards the Col des  Vignettes. The Austrians followed a guided party and Cosley-Houston had Kathy and Mark to get them through safe.</P>

<P>The next morning conditions looked good for what would be the last day of the tour. Early morning sun was breaking over the Pennine Alps and <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-vignettes.jpg">the Vignette Hut</A>. Again, we had <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-david-mark.jpg">great snow</A> as we descended on to the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-charmotane.jpg">Col de Charmotane</A>. With a few <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-charmotane-2.jpg">last minute tweaks</A> we were off for the first of the 3 cols and our last day on the Haute Route. We crossed the Col de l'Eveque and enjoyed great snow down the glacier, but we had to quickly stop short as our turns took us to the start of another ice fall. More back stepping and we found the right route. Over the Col du Mont Brule and then start <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valpelline-1.jpg">the last long climb</A> up to the Col de Valpelline.</P>

<P>Steve stopped for some much needed <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-valpelline-2.jpg">med repair</A>, but we were soon at the top! We then started the long, final  descent down the Stockji and Zmutt glaciers to Zermatt.</P>

<P>And so we had done it! It had taken us 6 days. We had travellled over 80km by skiing and climbing much of the time above 3000m. We had crossed 17 glaciers and 15 cols. We had met some <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-zermatt-2.jpg">great folk</A> and avoided skiing into any nasty big holes in the snow. We had some great powder and some <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-zmutt.jpg">awful mush</A>.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-zermatt.jpg">Zermatt</A> was drawing towards the end of its season, but there was one last party to be had. The <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrouille_des_Glaciers">Patrouilles des Glaciers race</A> from Zermatt to Verbier was due to kick off on our last night, so we stayed up to <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-patrouille.jpg">watch the athletes</A> race back over much of the territory we had covered. Amazingly, the winners would reach Verbier in a time of only 7 hours or less!!!</P>

<P>And so we returned to where it began in Chamonix and Argentiere. We stayed at <A HREF="http://www.la-boerne.fr/situation/index_en.htm">La Boerne</A> above Argentiere, which is an amazing little place that looks like it's been carved out of one huge tree. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-boerne.jpg">Very funky</A> :o) Our last meal was shared with a group of 3 blokes from Barcelona who were setting off on the Haute Route the next day. Most of the discussion over dinner was filled with questions about specific routes and how many bits of gear we had taken to keep the weight down. "Tell me Paul, how many pants do you have"!</P>

<P>As always, it felt odd to have stopped. We had been going at it hard for a week, so our smiles were <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-cham-1.jpg">the smiles of the just</A>. And as we looked at <A HREF="../images/Skiing/hr-blanc.jpg">the mountains</A> for one last time, we were already planning next year :o) Many thanks for company on the way round from Leo and Steve, and from us to the other skiers we met. Thanks also to Kathy and Mark at Cosley-Houston for the excellent info on their web site and Peter Cliff for last minute advice on rope lengths!</P>
