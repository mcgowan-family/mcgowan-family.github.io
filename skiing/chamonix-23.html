<br>
<P>It had been 3 years since our last winter holiday to the Alps. That had coincided with the outbreak of the pandemic that we came to know as Covid 19, or Coronavirus. In the interim, I had <a href="../images/Family/left-knee-0322.jpeg">a half-knee put into my left knee</a>, in Feb 2022, and the metalwork from the osteotomy <a href="../images/Family/right-knee-0718.jpeg">removed from my right knee</a> in Oct 22. Moss was 3 years older and this was to be his first outing to the Alps in winter. Sarah and Bryher decided at the last minute to stay home.Chamonix was the destination and our favourite Gite la Montagne.</P>

<P>We decided to take the Chunnel rather than the boat and it worked very well. We also decided to return to Dole, as it had worked so well last time. This year, I found a great AirBnB on a <i>peniche</i>, <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-01.jpeg">a canal barge</a>, sleeping in the captains cabin!.The barge was moored on <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-02.jpeg">a short canal</a> called the Canal Charles Quint, that branches off the Doubs river right in the middle of Dole. Very handy and a fun experience.It was lovely to be <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-03.jpeg">back in Dole</a> again :)</P>

<P>As normal we arrived on Sunday afternoon. We headed up to Le Tour to check out the snow. There hadn't been any fresh snow in a few weeks and it had been very warm, so I wondered if we would find any in the Vormaine. Fortunately they had managed it well and there was a good snow pack over the skiing area, but the surrounding slopes were very patchy. We got the sledges out and <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-04.jpeg">mucked about that first afternoon</a>, to give Moss a feel for the area.By the way, Patrick was now at an age where getting photos is very trcky!</P>

<P>Moss wasn't keen to do ski school as Bryher and Patrick had told him horror stories. But it seemed the best option to allow me to take Patrick up the mountain for a few hours. As it happened, the ski school was full, so it wasn't an option. So it was back to the school of Dad. </P>

<P>The conditions on the Monday morning were a hard frozen surface after a cold night freezing yesterday's soft snow. It would soften during the morning, but it would be a tricky start for Moss. As I thought, as he got his skis on, he was sliding all over the place and not too happy. But I noticed an older French instructor getting young children to place their hands on their knees. This brought the weight forwards and gave them something to do with their hands at the same time. It was like magic and Moss never looked back</a>.</P>

<p>The first day had been great. It was Spring skiing conditions with temperatures in the high teens and hard, crusty snow in the morning, softening as the day wore on. Moss was now a skier! Patrick had been happy to ski with us during the day and we managed a few runs together as a group of three. </p>


<p>Tuesday's weather was similar. A cold start in the shade of the mountains, under blue skies. A new feature at the Vormaine was <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-05.jpeg">dog sledding</a>. Maybe one for a future trip!</p>


<P>We were lucky to be able to park in the small car park by the Vormaine slopes, which meant that it was <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-06.jpeg">easy to have lunch</a> out of the back of the Land Rover.But covert means were required to capture <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-07.jpeg">this shot of Patrick</a>!</P>

<P>Our second day followed much of the same pattern as the first, with Moss becoming increasingly comfortable on skis. Patrick had remembered all his skills from 3 years before and was very confident. By the end of the second day, Moss was <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23.mov">confidently skiing</a> <video width="320" height="240" controls>down the Forest Trail. A sign of <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-08.jpeg">a good day</a>.</P>


<p>A stretch target for Moss had been that we might get him up the mountain during the week. This would need a combination of him having a good time and feeling confident, an ability to safely ski on the bigger and busier slopes, and the ability to safely get on and off a range of ski lifts. To his great credit he was up for it by day 3 and we set off up <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-09.jpeg">the Tete du Balme</a>, from the glitzy, brand new ski station at the bottom.</p>


<p>Going up the mountain opened up a host of new options. This seemed <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-10.jpeg">too good a shot to miss</a>. We went down to Vallorcine, with a  plan to lunch at the lovely little cafe at <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-11.jpeg">the train station</a>, but found that it was closed, hopefully just for refurbishment.</p>

<p>We headed back up <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-12.jpeg">on the cable car</a>, then skied <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-13.jpeg">all over the mouuntain</a>, including Moss's <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-14.jpeg">first red run</a>!</p>


<p>A key part of going up the mountain, is of course the lovely mountain huts. That meant a little bit of <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-15.jpeg">Moss-hauling</a> to get him there.But <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-16.jpeg">it was worth it</a>!</p>

<p>We had experimented with ski du fond last time in Chamonix and decided to try it again. It was <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-17.jpeg">a lovely day</a>, with some <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-18.jpeg">exciting extra bits</a>, the <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-19.jpeg">traditional lunch stop</a> at the gite and Moss seemed pretty pleased <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-20.jpeg">with the outcome</a>. Thanks to Patrick for being a good sport :)</p>
    
<p>We spent the afternoon in the pool which was great fun and Moss's first experience of the big slide! Sadly Patrick didn't get the chance to get into the hot tub - maybe next year? And in the evening, we enjoyed our traditional visit to <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-21.jpeg">La Monchu</a>!</p>

    
<p>Our last full day in Chamonix dawned and <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-22.jpeg">it was a beauty</a>. The plan was to head up to the Mer de Glace at Montenvers, hopefully not on <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-23.jpeg">this train</a>! The ride up was great and then the  hike down to the glacier. It is wonderful to be able to <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-24.jpeg">get up this close</a>, and the kids <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-25.jpeg">love going inside</a>, but sad to see that it continues to retreat.</p>
    

<p>We took <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-26.jpeg">a short wander</a> down the trail below the Glaciorium that brought us to a nice bend in the railway line with great views <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-27.jpeg">back up to Aiguille Verte</a> and <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-28.jpeg">down over the viaduct</a> towards Chamonix.</p>

    
<p>We finished off the week with an impromptu outing <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-29.jpeg">to see Chamonix play ice hockey</a> against a visiting team from Paris.Patrick and Moss <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-30.jpeg">really got into the swing of it</a>. I <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-31.jpeg">quite enjoyed it too</a> :)</p>
    
    
<p>But all too soon it was time to leave <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-32.jpeg">our little den</a> in the Gite la Montagne for another year.We headed back up through France, with a brief stop for a bit of <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-34.jpeg">rugby and poutine</a> at <a href="../images/Skiing-23/chamonix-23-33.jpeg">Le Dropkick Bar</a> in Troyes.We spent the night in Riems and then made our way back through le Chunnel, just in time to see Scotland lose to France in the 6 Nations :(</p>
