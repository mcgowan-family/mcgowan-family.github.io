<P>This was our first ski trip away together. Patrick stayed home with Grandma. The forecast was great, with a couple of feet of snow before we arrived, and that's just the way it turned out. The Col des Montets was closed, so we went round the north shore of Lake Geneva and <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-trient.jpg">over the Col de Forclaz</A> from Martigny. </P>

<P>Vallorcine is a small village with a few homes, a train station, one restaurant and the The Bellevue Lodge. It's a great little place and the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-hotel-1.jpg">views from the hotel</A> are fantastic. </P>

<P>Steve and Rose were waiting for us when we got there. They had already skied for two days and were well into things. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-rose-steve.jpg">This is them at Flegere</A>. Rose is wearing Margot, or was it Marge?</P>

<P>We got <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-base-1.jpg">Sarah kitted out</A> and headed round to Le Tour for our first day. The Olympic restaurant became <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-olympic-1.jpg">our unofficial base</A> for the next few days. The snow was still coming down and there was <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-base-2.jpg">an excellent base</A>. Sarah was great! We skied most of the day down at the bottom, but ventured up onto the upper slopes to make our way back to Vallorcine. It was a pretty, but long descent <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-forest-road-1.jpg">down to Vallorcine</A>.</P>

<P>The second day was sunnier and we got more really nice runs in. Sarah's technique was picking up, but it was important to schedule appropriate <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-olympic-2.jpg">rest breaks</A> at the Olympic as well. Great views up to the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-tour.jpg">Glacier du Tour</A>. I got some  amazing off-piste runs down into the Vallorcine vallley from the top of the Aiguillette lift. Check out http://www.chamonet.com/ski-areas/le-tour-and-vallorcine-domaine-de-balme-off-piste-skiing.htm, I did Combes de la Vormain and 2a and 2b from Aiguillette des Posettes.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-claire-dave.jpg">Dave and Claire</A> arrived on Friday night and we <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-gondola.jpg">all headed out</A> skiing on Saturday. This was Steve and Rose's last day, so they got a few good runs in and headed off for the plane. Always important <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-warm-up.jpg">to stretch</A>.</P>

<P>We headed down to <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-chamonix.jpg">Chamonix</A>. Nice light on the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-chamonix-2.jpg">Aiguilles du Midi</A>. It had been <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-base-3.jpg">a great trip</A> and as <A HREF="../images/Skiing/vallor-hotel-2.jpg">the clouds were rolling in</A>, we headed off for Geneva.</P>
