<P>Made it out to <A HREF="../images/Skiing/telluride.jpg">Telluride</A>, Co with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/team-tel.jpg">Dominic and Andrew</A>. Telluride has a reputation for challenging runs, but recent years have seen the addition of plenty of easier stuff. Many of the steeps in the area were bumped out and our technique was found a little wanting at times. Try The Plunge on day 1 for a laugh.</P>

<P>We flew into Montrose and enjoyed the great run up the highwy into the San Juans. Make sure you have decent insurance for the hire car - you never know <A HREF="../images/Skiing/sump-guard.jpg">what you might meet</A> on the road.</P>

<P>Accomodation at the Telluride Lodge was excellent. Suggest getting a condo, rather than one of the fairly small rooms.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Skiing/paul.jpg">Weather</A> was great all week, and we did a mix of on and off-piste. There's plenty of off-piste in area - mainly through the trees. If you want to get to the real powder stashes, it's worth hiking. Bald Mountain isn't bad, but it really gets fun out on <A HREF="../images/Skiing/andy-powder.jpg">Gold Hill</A>.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Skiing/andy-bear.jpg">Bear Creek</A>, accessed from Gold Hill, is a classic. I won't say too much, but have your serious head on and keep to the high ground under the eastern cliffs to avoid some unplanned drop-offs. This is Andrew coming down <A HREF="../images/Skiing/waterfall-chute.jpg">Waterfall Chute</A>.</P>

<P>I got a couple of days of <A HREF="../images/Skiing/topping-out.jpg">back-country</A> in round at Ophir. The first day, was a climb up Waterfall Canyon, then onto <A HREF="../images/Skiing/yellow-mountain.jpg">Yellow Mountain</A>. The prize was a 2000ft powder descent down Mustangs. the second day, was a longer hike up Swamp Canyon (also accessed from Ophir), then a climb onto <A HREF="../images/Skiing/us-grant-peak.jpg">US Grant Peak</A>. Topped out around 12 500 and another 2000ft of powder back into the canyon. Don't forget the beacon, pole and shovel - and take a buddy.</P>
