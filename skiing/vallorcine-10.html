<P>We had been skiing to Vallorcine as a couple the year before, so we knew what a great little place it was. We decided to go back with a bigger group and do a chalet holiday. It turned out to be j<a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-01.jpg">ust the right mix of folk</a>.</P>

<P>Patrick wasn't with us in 2009, but <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-02.jpg">he wasn't going to miss out</a> this time. He was quite <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-03.jpg">the little snow bum</a>.</P>

<P>Even though it was very much a family trip, I did sneak away for the one wee itinerary. This is <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-04.jpg">looking south</a> from the Aiguille Rouge ridge to Aiguille Verte. I set off from the top of the Flegere network and crossed over<a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-05.jpg"> the Col de la Floria</a>. You can just see a Norwegian couple climbing above me. The <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-06.jpg">Combe de la Balme</a> beckoned. After crossing the Col de Berard I had<a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-07.jpg"> a clear run down the Combe de Berard to Vallorcine</a>. And <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-08.jpg">what a run</a> it was. Definitely in <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-09.jpg">my happy space</a> :o)</P>

<P>It was great taking Sarah round Chamonix. This is <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-10.jpg">the square in front of Snells</a>,with the Midi in the background.</P>

<P>Back in Vallorcine, <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-11.jpg">everyone was enjoying</a> having the kids around. And the chalet was <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-12.jpg">fantastic</a>. All sorts of stuff to see from the deck - this was <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-13.jpg">a heli rescue</a> following a big slide in the chutes I had skied the season before. There was all sorts of stuff to see <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-14.jpg">in the village</a> too. And the mountains were <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-15.jpg">never far away</a>.</P>

<P>Eventually the hour came when <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-16.jpg">Sarah booted up</a> and hit the slopes. So me, Patrick & Bryher <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-17.jpg">hit Chamonix</a> and pretended to be mountain guides for the day. And then we caught up with Sarah at the end of the day and got in <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-18.jpg">a bit of cross-country</a>. Think Sarah may have been better than me :o)</P>

<P>I managed to convince <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-20.jpg">Byron</a> to go for a cheeky run down <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-19.jpg">the Valle Blanche</a>. We opted for one of the more adventurous routes, that took us out <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-21.jpg">along the Midi Plan</a>, where I had climbed with the Steves and Leo a couple of years previously. We dropped down the face of the Rognon du Plan and ran behind the Petit Rognon with contrails breaking through <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-22.jpg">the blue skies above</a>. All the way down we were looking across to <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-23.jpg">the Dent du Geant </a>and the Grandes Jorasses. And looking back up to <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-24.jpg">the Glaciers d'Envers du Plan</a> now above us. After a superb last run down the face, we bottomed out on <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-25.jpg">the Mer de Glace</a> and ended up in the slightly surreal surroundings of <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-26.jpg">a mountain cafe</a>.</P>

<P>I think <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-27.jpg">Patrick enjoyed the train</a> the best. Bryher enjoyed <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-28.jpg">dressing up with Mummy </a>the best. And everyone got out <a href="../images/Skiing/vallorcine-10-29.jpg">what they put in</a>.</P>
