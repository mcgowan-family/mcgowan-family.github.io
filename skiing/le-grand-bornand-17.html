<p>After a gap last year, it was great to have Bryher along again <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-1-feb-17.jpg">as we sailed into Calais</a> on the 11th of Feb. We decided to drive down and spent the night at <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-2-feb-17.jpg">the fabulous little town of Auxonne</a> en route (where it turns out Napoleon learned his artillery!).</p>

<p>We were heading for the village of Chinaillon, by Le Grand Bornand, in the Massif Aravis. It was an hour south of Geneva, not too far from Chamonix and it turned out to be the perfect destination.</p>

<p>The kids couldn't have been happier, as it turned out there was <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-3-feb-17.jpg">an excellent sledging slope</a> right outside the picturesque little gite L'Isalou. Bryher had a good sense of balance <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-4-feb-17.jpg">on Patrick's snow scooter</a>, and <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-5-feb-17.jpg">a good sense of slapstick</a> in the deeper snow. The snow had been non-existent just a week earlier, but as you can see, <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-6-feb-17.jpg">a lot had fallen</a> just before we arrived.</p>


<p>That night, we descended to Le Grand Bornand for pizza and on the way back, were treated to this <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-7-feb-17.jpg">amazing moonrise </a>over the Massif Aravis.</p>


<p>We hit the slopes the next morning, but only made it as far as a lovely little slopeside cafe for <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-8-feb-17.jpg">the first chocolat chauds</a> of the trip. But we did finally get skiing, and <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-9-feb-17.jpg">Bryher and Patrick</a> went straight up onto a lovely green called Le Lac.</p>

<p>It was an eventful first day, which almost ended in disaster with Bryher heading off down the slope out of control doing 30 mph and heading straight for a restaurant. Fortunately I got to her before her momentum took her into their kitchens. Everything seemed better with <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-10-feb-17.jpg">a bit of last night's pizza </a>out of the back of the Volvo :)</p>


<p>Next day dawned as fabulously sunny as the last. Looked like we were going to be lucky with the weather as well as the snow. After yesterday's excitement, it took a while to prize Bryher out of the hotel room. But once we got up there, it was <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-11-feb-17.jpg">all smiles :)</a> Today was Valentine's Day, so it seemed fitting <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-12-feb-17.jpg">to send this one</a> back to <a href="../images/Family/moss-and-mum-oct-15.jpg">loved ones left behind</a>.</p>


<p>Half way through the week, and I thought  we should have a day off from skiing to explore some of the other bits of <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-15-feb-17.jpg">this lovely mountain landscape</a>. The gite had <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-13-feb-17.jpg">snow shoes </a>that they were happy for us to use, so we headed off up the north side of the valley and found <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-14-feb-17.jpg">a nice little spot </a>to pitch up. I'd packed a picnic and <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-16-feb-17.jpg">the kids laid in</a> with gusto. Bryher was <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-17-feb-17.jpg">loving the snow shoes</a>, but Patrick did one on his toes in his new snow boots.</p>


<p>The little village of Chinaillon was very traditional. There was a working dairy farm in the chalet next door. <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-18-feb-17.jpg">This is the byre</a>, located under the living accomodation. This place is the heart of Reblochon territory, so we had to take some home with us :) </p>

<p>The week was drawing to a close, but <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-20-feb-17.jpg">the donuts kept on coming</a>. The kids had to do something to work off all those carbs. So we <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-19-feb-17.jpg">headed up in the space age tunnel </a>one more time with a cunning plan for some movie mayhem.<a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-21-feb-17.m4v">Check out these turns</a>  <video width="320" height="240" controls>

<p>There was just <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-22-feb-17.jpg">one last apres-ski picnic</a> in the back of the Volvo. Then it was the long ride home and <a href="../images/Skiing%2017/le-grand-bornand-23-feb-17.jpg">back over on the ferry</a> to Blighty. A really cracking week. Can't wait for next year!</p>
