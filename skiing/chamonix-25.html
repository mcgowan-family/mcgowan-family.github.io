<P>It had been a couple of years since <a href="https://mcgowan-family.github.io/skiing/chamonix-23.html">Mossy and Patrick joined me in Chamonix</a>. That was Moss's first ski trip and he was looking forward to another. Sarah and Bryher were coming to, which was great. Less great, was that 2 weeks before we left, AirBnB decided to cancel our booking with Gite la Montagne. We still don't know what happened, but they took them off their books. With very little notice, I managed to find us somewhere on the other side of Mont Blanc in the Aosta Valley for the start of the week and somewhere in Chamonix for the end of the week.</P>

<P>We took the tunnel again to save a couple of hours as we would have a long run down to Dole on the other side. That all worked out great and it was nice to be able to finally show Sarah <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-01.jpeg">the lovely town of Dole</a>.</P>

<P>The place in Italy I found was in this incredible little hamlet called <a href="https://www.valgrisencheski.it/en/">Valgrisenche</a> ,up the last side valley before Mont Blanc. The side valley was quite high, so there was a risk we might not make it up the very narrow, winding climb if there was any fresh snow. In the end that wasn't an issue.</P>
    

<P>Our accommodation was <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-06.jpeg">this great little traditional chalet</a>, built into the hillside and walking distance from the one very small lift that serves the locals. The whole place had a 'locals' feel to it and, when I finally bumped into someone from the UK who was living there in a camper van, they asked 'How on earth did you find this place??'. The owner of our chalet, Marcello, was an incredibly friendly guy. As were the local caretakers - Elena and Aurelio.</P>
 
<P>We did ski a couple of days at Valgrisenche, but we also headed down into the valley and along to Pila for one day, which was nice to give the kids a sense of a bigger mountain resort with more runs. Pila is mainly blues and reds and <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-02.jpeg">Bryher wasn't too happy</a>, when we got to the top of the mountain and it was only red runs back down!</P>

<p>Pila was a lovely place to spend the day for all of us and this was really the only full days skiing on the trip. As you can see, Bryher is <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-04.jpeg">getting into the swing of things now</a>. We did our normal thing of buying filled baguettes down in the valley, then <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-03.jpeg">enjoying them slope side</a> during the day.</p>

    
<p>Everyone came on well in their skiing, especially considering Bryher hadn't been for a few years.</p>

<p>The next day we did some nice wildlife watching from the chalet in Valgrisenche, with Alpine Ibex (or Bouqetin) clearly visible across the valley. Sarah and Bryher also <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-05.jpeg">broke out the snow shoes</a> and went for a little hike.</p>
 

<p>All too soon it was time to head off, back through the tunnel, to Chamonix. This was the first time I had crossed through the tunnel, so <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-07.jpeg">that was quite a treat</a>.</p>


<P>As in years past, this was more an alpine holiday, than a ski holiday, so the days in Chamonix were more about getting up into the mountains and enjoying the scenery and other attractions.</P>

<p>We took the mountain train up to Montenvers, to check out the improvements that had been made up there since we last visited. It was a gorgeous day and the <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-08.jpeg">views of the Mer de Glace</a> and the Massif were breathtaking.</p>
    


<p>The old gondola had closed and the new one that took you closer to the glacier was now open. So we went down to ice grotto, which was <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-09.jpeg">a first for Sarah and Bryher</a>. A lot of the carvings were new, but I think I remember <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-10.jpeg">the 'ice bar'</a> from the last time. Patrick isn't that much taller than the rest of us, he's just standing on a block :)</p>
    


<p>Every time we had been to Chamonix over past years, Patrick had wanted to do the tobaggan at Les Plannards, but it had never worked out. This was to be the year! <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-11.jpeg">Everyone loved it</a> :)</p>

<p>Two years ago, we managed to get to see the Chamonix Pioneers in the old ice rink, which was a great atmosphere. The Pioneers were playing away this week, but their was an amateur game on, which was still <a href="../images/Skiing-25/chamonix-25-12.jpeg">a fun spectacle to watch</a> with the locals.</p>


<p>All too soon, our week was over. We made our way back, via Switzerland and the Jura route, spent the night in Rouen, then the tunnel back the next day. A great week. I think everyone enjoyed themselves. Maybe no winter trip next year because of exams. We will see :)</p>
