<P>It had been a few years since I'd strapped the planks on, so it was with oddly mixed feelings that I set off on the 444 from Charlton Kings to Gatwick - ultimate destination, Champoluc, on the Italian side of the Pennine Alps, just south of Monte Rosa.</P>

<P>The trip had come together really quickly.I was delighted that I'd be off skiing with Andrew again. Andrew had already travelled out with Hilary to meet up with his cousin Brian who, as usual, had taken a small apartment in Champoluc for the whole season. We would be staying at the excellent Villa Maria Hotel.</P>

<P>But by the morning after, our focus was <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-01.jpg">solely on the skiing</a>.</P>

<P>Andrew had taken the leap earlier in the season and invested in a complete tele set up - skis, poles, bindings, boots. That opened up a whole new set of options, and on the first morning, as Brian and Hilary headed off to Gressoney, we started <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-02.jpg">skinning up</a> to the Bettolina Peak at around 3000 meters. It was really great to have <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-03.jpg">a whole new ski experience with Andrew</a>, and kind of surprising given how long we've both been at it :)</P>

<P>After an hour or so, we reached the drop in point and switched set up and <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-04.jpg">put some  clothes back on</a>. There were a number of options for dropping in. Ours was <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-05.jpg">pretty straightforward</a> and the good news was, that the snow was pretty much <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-06.jpg">perfect powder</a>. Happy days :)</P>

<P>The route dropped down from Bettolina, through the upper Alpe Verra and on down to the Plan du Verra There was a little sting in the tail, with a very windy forest trail down to St.Jacques, where we arrived to find the perfect little alpine bar, serving lunch. And a very informal taxi service to take us from the bar back down to Champoluc. A fantastic first day.</P>

<P>Brian joined us for day 2, but only on the <i>very clear</i> understanding that there was to be no skinning and no glaciers! So we headed over to Gressoney and went up to Punta Indren, from where we made a high level traverse and dropped into the <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-08.jpg">Val de Luz</a>. The conditions were pretty ugly compared to the day before - heavily tracked out, but here and there we found some good sections to put some turns in. </P>

<P>Andrew and Brian planned to ski as a group with Hilary on the last day, so I decided to head off into the fabled Val d'Otro. It was one of the runs we had thought that we all might try, but the conditions were likely to be pretty ugly. I decided not to be put off by this, and treat it as a bit of an adventure :)</P>

<p>I saved some time on getting over to Gressoney by heading up the valley to Frachey and getting the funicular up the mountain. So it was early when I set off from Salatti to skin up to the <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-09.jpg">Col de Zube</a>. It was a really lovely skin up, with a few guided parties in the valley. I should perhaps have taken more heed of the fact that none of the guided parties crossed the col! </p>

<p><a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-10.jpg">The mountain ambience </a>in the Val d'Otro is superb. Which was just as well, as the skiing was shocking. It would be fair to describe my approach as defensive, as I made my way down. But the scenery really was stunning and I had the whole place to myself - another clue there.</p>

<p>Having gingerly made my way down through the upper valley, it was a treat to arrive at the uninhabited mountain hamlet of <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-11.jpg">Pianmisura</a>. There were Chamois in the valley just above the huts and a couple of climbers had arrived to spend the day. From there, it was track sking down through <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-12.jpg">the village</a>, before I had to lash the skis to the pack and hike down to Alagna.</p>

<p>Andrew and Hilary headed off the next morning and I decided to go for a nice relaxing hike back up to the <a href="../images/Skiing/champoluc-13-13.jpg">Plan du Verra</a> that we had skied down to on the first day. It all worked out perfectly, including a lovely lunch at that same bar, sat outside in the sun and thinking how amazing it was to just be able to get off and climb and ski the alps for a few days.</p>
