<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Bernese Oberland 4000ers, May 2007</H1>
</DIV>

<P>After last years adventures on the <A HREF="haute-route-06.html">Haute Route</A>, we were keen to get back up into the high mountains. We decided on the Bernese Oberland as a good destination. The Austrian party from last year had recommended it, it's the largest high mountain space in Europe so snow cover would be likely to hold well into May and once again, <A HREF="http://www.cosleyhouston.com/berner-tour.htm">Cosley-Houston</A> had some good beta on the route.</P>

<P>The rough plan was to head up from Grindelwald to the Jungfraujoch on the mountain railway. From there, we would spend the next week making our way from hut to hut and summitting on as many peaks as we could safely manage. We would start at the Monchsjochhutte - both Monch and Jungfrau being possible from there. Then on to the Finsteraarhornhutten via the Gross and Hinter Fiescherhorns. With luck we would then ascend the Finsteraarhorn before heading over the Grunhornlucke pass to the Konkordiahutten from where we would try for the Gross Grunhorn and exit the system via the Aletschhorn. Very challenging and it would need good weather throughout. The  trip would take place over Europe's largest glacier system centred around <A HREF="../images/Skiing/konkordia-platz-07.jpg">Konkordiaplatz</A>.</P>

<P>It was only going to be me and Leo this year, so we worked up the logistics and hit the road. We rolled into Grindelwald with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/eiger1-07.jpg">the Eiger</A> looming above and a day later we were heading up on the Jungfraubahn. At Kleine Shiedegg, there were great views of <A HREF="../images/Skiing/monch-eiger-07.jpg">the Monch and Jungfrau</A>. With luck and the right weather, we would be on those summits during the next week.</P>


<P>The railway ends at 'Europes highest point' - the Jungfraujoch. From there a short skin, with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-jungfrau-07.jpg">awesome views of the Jungfrau</A>, had us at the foot of the Monch. The training we had put in paid off - i.e. we hadn't done enough - <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-crevasse-07.jpg">Leo dropped a bag</A> in one crevasse while I almost lost <A HREF="../images/Skiing/crevasse-07.jpg">a ski pole in another</A>. An hours faffing and crevasse diving had us back on track  and we steadily climbed <A HREF="../images/Skiing/paul-monch1-07.jpg">the ridge</A> to summit on the Monch in good guide time. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/camp-leo-monch-07.jpg">Great views of Jungfrau</A> and <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-trugberg1-07.jpg">the Trugberg</A> from the top.</P>


<P>We were knackered by the time we got to the Monschjochhutte. I then had my worst onset of altitude sickness which was to last for the next 3 or 4 days. Rapid ascent from valley on the train didn't help, but I seemed to have bunged up sinuses which made matters worse. We had to sack off the Jungfrau the next day due to me being out of it. Leo went for a reconnoitre of the Jungfraufirn glacier and then we both went out for a little tour when he got back over to the south face of the Eiger. Great views from here of <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-trugberg2-07.jpg">the Trugberg</A> and yesterdays summit of <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-monch-07.jpg">the Monch</A>.</P>

<P>To stay on track with our plan, we needed to head over to the Finsteraarhorn hut the next day. An early start had us <A HREF="../images/Skiing/paul-feischerhorn-07.jpg">up near the ridge</A> before noon. A good pace. We were soon <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-feischerhorn1-07.jpg">on the top of the Gross Fiescherhorn</A> but as they say, getting up is only half the battle. With <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-feischerhorn2-07.jpg">a bergschrund looming</A>, it was good to know our system  worked :o)</P>

<P>We summitted the Hinter Feisherhorn in terrible conditions. Everyone else bailed out, but we were determined to summit. Poor judgement or well balanced assessment? But we got up and down OK and the descent down the Fiescherfirn was suitably absorbing as we dropped through multiple ice falls with seracs looming above.</P>

<P>The Finsteraarhorn hut couldn't be described as <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-finsteraarhorn-07.jpg">ski in - ski out</A>, but it was certainly well appointed once you got to it.</P>

<P>Weather the next day was a bit mental. No one sumitted on the Finsteraarhorn, so we headed over <A HREF="../images/Skiing/grunhornlucke-07.jpg">the Grunhornlucke pass</A> to the Konkordia hut. Once again, <A HREF="../images/Skiing/konkordia1-07.jpg">the hut position</A> has suffered somewhat from dropping glacier levels.</P>

<P>The forecast for the next day looked favourable, so we elected to go for a big day and try for the Gross Grunhorn. It's 1400m of ascent from the Konkordiaplatz with a number of sections exposed to serac fall. We got a great early start. There was a <A HREF="../images/Skiing/konkordia-platz2-07.jpg">special blue light </A>over the Konkordiaplatz and surrounding peaks as we set off from the hut. Soon, the sun was touching <A HREF="../images/Skiing/jungfrau-07.jpg">the summit of the Jungfrau</A>. Leo had picked up a mechanical the day before and we hadn't done a proper fix the night before. Pretty soon after this shot of <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-aletschhorn-07.jpg">Leo with the Aletschorn behind</A>, he had to return to the hut to make good the repair.</P>

<P>With the help of the hut gaurdian, Leo made a good job of the fix and had a great day climbing up to and descending from <A HREF="../images/Skiing/grunhornlucke-07.jpg">the Grunhornlucke</A>.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, I continued up to the summit of the Gross Grunhorn. It was a pretty sketchy ascent with many <A HREF="../images/Skiing/gross-grunhorn1-07.jpg">exposed sections</A> requiring a <I>no fall</I> approach. As forecast, it was a great day and the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/paul-gross-grunhorn-07.jpg">views from the top</A> were amazing, with the Mont Blanc massif, Matterhorn, Monte Rosa and Dent Blanche all clearly visible.</P>

<P>The sun was still out when we both got back from our adventures, so the only thing to do was <A HREF="../images/Skiing/konkordia-07.jpg">toast our good fortune</A>, settle back and wait for dinner. Not everyone was having it so easy. A big group of Brits up on the Kransberg had got into difficulties that required multiple sorties by the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/chopper-07.jpg">air rescue guys</A>.</P>

<P>The weather deteriorated from this point. Avalanches had made our original plan of ascending the Hasler Rib to the Aletschorn look like a bad move. Plan B was to head up the Jungfrau, but as we ascended the Junfraufirn glacier, it was clear the only place we were heading was the valley. In fact, this turned into quite a testing skin, with crevasses looming on all sides and the odd serac dropping off the cliffs above. As ever, getting back from the wilderness was a bit of an odd experience, with Japanese tourists snapping pictures of the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/bernese-end-07.jpg">grubby climbers</A>.</P>

<P>We dropped back down into the valley and got scrubbed up in the excellent <A HREF="http://www.mountainhostel.ch/index_e.htm">Mountain Hostel</A> in Grund. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/leo-brolly-07.jpg"><I>Umbrella Boy</I></A> took his gear back to the rental and we found the only nite spot in Grindelwald to spend our last night in. A good time was had by all.</P>

<P>Another year and another amazing trip. Five glaciers, four 4000ers, three mountain huts, two crevasses, one mountain train and many thousands of feet in ascent. Bring on the next one :o)</P>
