<P>Michael sourced some flights to Bergamo, so we popped across to Italy for a short weeks skiing in the Aosta Valley. Unusually, we planned to stay in the valley and ski a number of resorts each day (as opposed to staying up at the resort). We arrived on Hogmanay and I entertained the locals by going kilted. Aosta is an excellent destination for Hogmanay - great atmosphere all night, town full of people, music & dancing, food & drink.</P>

<P>Over the 4 days in the mountains, we skied at Pila, Courmayeur, La Thuile, La Rosiere and the Monte Rosa area.</P>

<P>Pila is the nearest resort to Aosta - 20 mins up the hairpins - but not much more than a days skiing.</P>

<P>Despite only being up at Courmayeur for the day, we managed a great off-piste route from <A HREF="../images/Skiing/arp.jpg">the Punta Arp cable station</A>. This route is little skied and our names were taken as we left the station (for reference, it's now illegal to go off-piste in Italy without an avy beacon). It was a great route with a long traverse to a col, followed by wide bowl skiing before <A HREF="../images/Skiing/Val-Veny.jpg">dropping in to Val Veny</A> (the Courmayeur face of Mont Blanc makes up the backdrop). Later on we found out how little skied this area really was.</P>

<P>La Thuile was a wee bit chilly, being mainly <I>East facing</I>, so we skied from Italy over into the French resort of La Rosiere. There was excellent powder between the pistes and even better mountain restaurants. It's hard to believe but <A HREF="../images/Skiing/chin-chin.jpg">Andrew and Michael</A> are actually enjoying themselves. The run down to the Little St.Bernard pass is one of the best.</P>

<P>We drove up to Champoluc, which is one of the 3 resorts that make up the Monte Rosa resort. Andrew's cousin Brian is spending the season there, and took us around the mountains. We skied over into Gressoney and then Alagna, before coming back off-piste via <A HREF="../images/Skiing/Punta-Indren.jpg">Punta Indren</A>. </P>
