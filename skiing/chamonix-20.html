<P>Sarah was well into recovery by now but still not feeling strong enough for skiing, so this year it would just be Patrick and me. We were planning to set of on the morning of the 15th of Feb, but out of nowhere Storm Dennis blew in as one of the most serious  extratropical cyclones on record. So we dropped everything, I shook Patrick awake and we set off into the night of the 14th to try and beat the storm to the Channel. It worked like a treat, and we crossed just before they closed the ferries down for the day! The news was full of this Coronavirus thing and apprently it was pretty bad in Northern Italy ...</P>

<P>I thought we'd try a new stop-off on the way down this year, so we broke our journey at <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-01.jpg">Dole in Burgundy</a>. What a fabulous spot! It rises up from <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-02.jpg">the Doubs river to a medieval chapel above</a>, with little cobbled streets encircling it. We arrived on <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-04.jpg">a sunny afternoon</a>, and I think we might get an earlier ferry next year as well. We'll certainly <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-03.jpg">come back to Dole</a>.</P>

<P>After a quick trip to Decathlon (another reason to come back to Dole) we headed on to Chamonix. I've always wanted to stop at <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-05.jpg">the Air Mont Blanc</a> - so we did :) The weather was lovely when we got into Chamonix and <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-06.jpg">Mont Blanc was shining above</a>. we had a wander round town, with the obligatory stop for <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-07.jpg">an Olympic snapshot</a>. As afternoon turned to evening, the light was perfect on <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-08.jpg">the Aiguilles Chamonix</a>.</P>

<P>We were staying at the Gite La Montagne again and we would make it a nice winter break, rather than too intensive on the skiing. So day 1 was just about getting rental gear sorted and spending a day at Tete de Balme. The snow wasn't as low in the valley as last year, so we weren't able to ski all the way down into Vallorcine. But that wasn't going to put <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-09.jpg">Patrick off his chi chis</a>! I thought <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-10.jpg">I better join in</a>.</P>

<P>Day 2 and I decided to take Patrick up to <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-11.jpg">Le Brevent</a>. We hadn't skied there before, so it would be nice to see somewhere different. <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-12.jpg">Patrick did really well</a> and had remembered some of his skills from last year.</P>

<p>We traditionally have Wednesday off skiing, but Patrick was really keen to try ski du fond. The trail that goes past our gite is part of the Bois du Bouchet and Orthaz circuit. So we drove into town, renting the gear and set  off back up the valley. Patrick loved it! It was a super day, with heavy snow falling at times as we skied up along the banks of the river Arve. We'll certainly do this again and hopefully Sarah can try it next year.</p>

<p>The ski du fond worked so well, that on the way back down, we <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-13.jpg">broke our journey at the gite</a> and I made us omelette for lunch.</p>


<P>I had wanted to take the mountain railway up to Montenvers this day as well, but there just wasn't time (after our long lunch break!), so we decided to <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-14.jpg">catch the train</a> on Thursday morning. The trip up was great and a bit of a dry run for hopefully getting Moss up there next year. We were blessed with another stunning day and <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-15.jpg">the views of the Mer de Glace from Montenvers</a> were really breathtaking. Patrick was super keen to see the crystals in the grotto. <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-16.jpg">This one was huge</a>!</P>

<P>A special thing to do up there is go down to the glacier. It's quite a hike down - further every year sadly. I can see a huge drop since I was first up there. It's pretty busy, but <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-17.jpg">the glacier is still an epic thing</a> to get up close to. In all the many times I had skied down to this point, I had never actually gone in the glacier, so it was lovely to <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-18.jpg">do that for the first time with Patrick</a>. Not surprisingly, <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-19.jpg">Patrick was enthralled</a> by the whole thing. I think he <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-20.jpg">wanted to move in</a>.</P>


<p>We came down from Montenvers and I figured we would have just enough time to get some good late afternoon runs in. So we <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-21.jpg">headed up to Flegere</a>, just to experience another area. Patrick had really put all his learning to work this week and had <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-22.jpg">skied some amazing new lines</a>. I had never been overly fond of Flegere, other than as a route to the backcountry, but it worked well for me and Patrick. This is us <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-23.jpg">at the very end of the day</a> as the last folk off the mountain.</p>


<p>Time for another tradition that evening and <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-24.jpg">our trip to La Monchu</a>. I still can't get the order right and we always end up with too much cheese! </p>

<p>We planned an easy half day for our last day. So back to where we started at Tete de Balme. <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-25.jpg">Nice view of Patrick in the Land Rover</a> with Aiguilles Rouge behind. And we finished it all off with <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-26.jpg">a lovely lunch at L'Olympique</a>.</p>


<p>We headed back from Chamonix and broke our journey at Dole again, which worked perfectly. Patrick and me camped in the back of the Land Rover down by the river in the municipal <i>aire</i>. We sped back from Dole to the coast, but our way was blocked by another storm in the channel and we ended up spending many hours in the car park waiting for the ferry. But we had <a href="../images/Skiing%2020/chamonix-20-27.jpg">plenty of provisions</a>, so not all bad :)</p>

<p>The news on what was now known as Covid 19 continued to get worse. It turned out that this was to be our last trip away for quite a long time.</p>
