<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Colorado & Utah 2005</H1>
</DIV>

<P>This was a fairly major trip with skiing in 6 resorts, over 2 states and quite a bit of backcountry. We also got some biking and hiking in, which you can read about <A HREF="../travel/co_ut_2005.html">elsewhere</A>.</P>

<P>We met up with Mike and Nikki in Denver who acted as great hosts for our first few days. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/brekky.jpg">We skied together</A> - by which I mean we chased Mike down the mountain - for two days, across Keystone and Breckenridge. It had been some time since the resorts had seen snow, but they retained a good coverage. We managed to get back into <I>The Burn</I> that I'd skied with Dominic a few years back and I skied <I>Pika</I> with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mike&nikki.jpg">Mike and Nikki</A>. All was good. </P>

<P>Mike & Nikki headed back to Denver and we headed for the great little town of <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-4.jpg">Crested Butte</A>. CB is an old mining town and still retains a lot of character. It sits amid a great range of hills and we stayed at the excellent <A HREF="../images/Skiing/elk-mountain-lodge.jpg">Elk Mountain Lodge</A>.</P>

<P>I started with some backcountry at Washington Gulch on a hill called Anthracite Mesa. Boot packed up onto the ridge, skinned up to <A HREF="../images/Skiing/anthracite-east.jpg">a great viewpoint</A> east over the valley with views across to Crested Butte Mountain and then up onto the summit with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/anthracite-west.jpg">views out west</A> to Mount Baldy. There were some excellent powder runs down a face known as Coneys (you can just see my tracks in the pic) which went at a pretty easy angle. Meanwhile Hilary got a cracking pair of Volkls in the resort which served her well over the rest of the trip.</P>

<P>Crested Butte had benefited from <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-2.jpg">a lot of snow</A> prior to our arrival and runs were open in the lift served backcountry that hadn't opened in 10 years. We skied all the lift served steep stuff - with the pick of the bunch being Third Bowl, Spellbound and Teocalli on the Northface and Banana and Funnel on the west.</P>

<P>The Crested Butte Mountain really is a steep hill and shouldn't be underestimated. The <A HREF="../images/Skiing/upper-peel-entry.jpg">West face</A> is best in the afternoon when the snow softens in the sun. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/upper-banana.jpg">Banana</A> is a great run with an amazing location below the Peak. The Funnel was a bit more remote, with a sketchy, skis off, entry. The North Face is great all day and has some pretty exciting stuff. The Third Bowl is probably the most entertaining. It has a series of fairly challenging entries before you get to the bowl. The first is <A HREF="../images/Skiing/third-bowl-entry.jpg">a traverse</A> and a jump turn affair. Backcountry skiing is all about <A HREF="../images/Skiing/third-bowl-cliffs.jpg">careful route selection</A>. A process of elimination eventually leads to <A HREF="../images/Skiing/third-bowl-chute.jpg">the most appropriate route</A> choice.</P>

<P>We skied 'lift served' for a couple of days, then Andrew and Hillary tried Nordic and I climbed <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-4.jpg">Mt Emmons</A>. The ascent of Emmons was pretty hard work at that altitude. A consistent skin from 9 to 12 000. The <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mt-emmons-west.jpg">summit ridge</A> was very windy and a small storm came in when I was on the top. I was keen to get off quick and decided to navigate down through the rock bands on the west face into Red Well basin. This was a great, if somewhat nervy descent. Didn't look like anyone had been there in a while and it seemed a long way from anywhere. It was good to leave <A HREF="../images/Skiing/red-well-exit.jpg">fresh tracks</A> in such a remote spot, but there was a degree of relief to make it out to the safe spaces around the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/slate-river.jpg">Slate River basin</A>. Hitched back into town with a big grin.</P>

<P>We drove north into Utah, stopping at the <A HREF="../images/USA/black-gorge.jpg">Black Gorge of the Gunnison</A> and at Moab. We did some biking and hiking at Moab, before heading on to Park City, UT.</P>

<P>Park City hadn't seen any fresh in a few weeks. We skied in bounds in Park City,  but it was clear that wouldn't entertain for long. I nipped into <A HREF="../images/Skiing/canyonlands-backcountry.jpg">the back country</A> off the back of Canyonlands and that was good snow. Summitted on Little Water Peak which was an easy ridge traverse from the gate at the top of Lift 9990. Excellent drop in and <A HREF="../images/Skiing/red-pine-canyon.jpg">swooping turns</A> down into Red Pine canyon coming back into the system.</P>

<P>We popped round to Alta and tried tele skiing. Despite a few awkward starts, we took to it pretty well. Heels were definitely lifted and knees were definitely dropped. I started to think it was easier than alpine in terms of being forced onto the balls of your feet. Suspect this may have something to do with me being so crap on the piste :o) Enjoyed it so much I nearly bought the gear in the Black Diamond  and REI stores in Salt Lake - next year.</P>

<P>Andrew and Hilary spent last snow day at Canyons. I drove south east to the Uintas and found a trailhead to skin from. Passed a few snowshoers just short of the summit. Sat there capturing the Kodak moment in my minds eye, looking west to the Wasatch, Provo Canyon and Mount Timpanogos. What a great way to spend the last winter day in the mountains.</P>

<P>Checked out Sundance on the way back from Uintas. Tiny resort (3 lifts) but an <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mount-timpanogos.jpg">amazing setting below Mount Timpanogos</A>. Should offer some amazing lift served backcountry off the top lift.</P>
