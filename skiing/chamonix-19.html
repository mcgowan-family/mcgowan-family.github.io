<P>We had a year off skiing last year, but this year, it was back to Chamonix with Patrick and Bryher. I had found <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-01.jpg">this great little place</a> just on the edge of Chamonix called the Gite la Montangne. Built by one of the Guide Chamonix back in the 70's, it was run and felt very much like a mountain hut.</P>

<P>We had stopped off at Auxonne on the way down as usual and picked up our rental skis from the guys at Tete de Balme. The <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-02.jpg">weather was great</a> all week!</P>

<P>We quickly got into a routine of picking up our lunch from Argentiere in the morning. Ski a couple of hours, eat our lunch on the slope, ski another couple of hours, then back to the gite. I cooked a range of delicious meals :) including the infamous 'Daddys famous carbonara' and always accompanied by a game of uno or two. This was <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-03.jpg">a tricky hand for Patrick</a> to play!</P>

<P>Halfway through the week we took the day off to head into Chamonix. A quick stop at <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-04.jpg">Olympic Park</a>. And thena  real treat of going up the Auiguille du Midi cable car to the observatory station right on the summit. it was another glorious day and the <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-05.jpg">view over the Mer de Glace</a>, with skiers in the foreground getting ready to ski down was fantastic. <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-06.jpg">Mont Blanc</a> was clearly visible. there are a number of new things to see up there now, including this '<a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-07.jpg">step into the void'</a>!</P>

<P>Everyone's skiing was excellent. This was my first trip since the serious leg surgery last summer, but it worked ok. Patrick and Bryher were both excellent. This shot is coming down in Vallorcine with <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-08.jpg">the Emosson Dam in the background</a>.</P>

<p>Getting a  video of the kids can often be a little tricky. But this is a nice sequence showing them both coming down from Tete du balme in nice style.</p>

<P>The weather was brilliant all week. This was <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-09.jpg">heading up towards the tete du Balme</a> summit towards the end of the week.</P>

<P>As usual, it was all quite tiring for the kids. Patrick never missed the opportunity to <a href="../images/Skiing%2019/chamonix-19-10.jpg">catch up on his sleep</a>.</P>


<p>It was a really fantastic week in the mountains. Sarah has stayed at home this time and as we were soon to find out, there was a very good reason for her long-term poor health. So it was good to get the kids away for one last trip before we all hunkered down for a long year ahead. Well done to Patrick and Bryher!/p>
