<p>It was just going to be the boys this year.  So we headed off by bus plane and car and finaly made it to the excellent HB Aosta Hotel, right in the heart of roman Aosta.</p>

<p>Next morning we hit the slopes and Patrick looked very pleased on his <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-1-feb-16.jpg">first belt lift</a>.</p>

<p>One of the benefits of skiing in Aosta, is that you have so much choice and can ski a number of amazing resorts. So we popped over to Cervinia and skied all the way into <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-2-feb-16.jpg">Switzerland</a>! <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-3-feb-16.jpg">Felt epic</a> to get Patrick across there. <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-4-feb-16.jpg">The views</a> made it all worthwhile. But it did <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-5-feb-16.jpg">tire the little fella out</a>.</p>


<p>Staying in Aosta had <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-6-feb-16.jpg">
</a>as well. There were a <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-7-feb-16.jpg">better selection of restaurants</a> that you would normaly get in a resort.</p>


<p>Patrick was straight on to the skiing. Looks <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-8-feb-16.jpg">very cool</a> here. We went to Cervinia for a second day, but made it <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-9-feb-16.jpg">more of a cruisy one</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-10-feb-16.jpg">The Aosta Valley</a> has amazing history going from the neolithic, through Roman and Napoleonic up to the present day. <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-11-feb-16.jpg">We took a day out</a> to go to the impressive Fort di Bard. It also has some <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-12-feb-16.jpg">very cool lifts</a>. And this is down below the Fort in the medieval<a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-13-feb-16.jpg"> village of Bard</a>. This is <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-14-feb-16.jpg">the Arch of Augustus</a> back in Aosta.</p>


<p>But we did do some skiing as well :) This is <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-15-feb-16.jpg">right at the top of the mountain </a>and, as you can see from the piste signs, there are no easy options down, but Patrick <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-17-feb-16.jpg">skied it beautifully</a>. The views on this last day <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-16-feb-16.jpg">were wonderful</a>. And it looked like Patrick had had <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-18-feb-16.jpg">a good week.</a></p>


<p>There was just time for <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-19-feb-16.jpg">one more hot chocoalate</a>. And then Patrick amazed me by finishing the whole thing off on a stunning big half pipe that we are <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-20-feb-16.jpg">stood at the top of here</a>.</p>


<p>It was <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-21-feb-16.jpg">a fun flight home</a>. But <a href="../images/Aosta%2016/aosta-22-feb-16.jpg">the luggage took AGES</a> to come back out of baggage handling. The girls had very kindly come down to Heathrow to pick us up and make it all a less stressful return to Cheltenham.</p>
