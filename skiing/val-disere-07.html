<P>The plan was to get 2007 off to a flying start with a ski trip to one of the great alpine destinations. Unfortunately I was sick as a parrot, but with the assistance of Andrew and the outstanding re-appearance of Alan onto our regular winter adventure, I made it to Exeter airport. Don't let anyone tell you that Exeter is a rubbish place to fly from. Go there, and find that out for yourself. Just kidding, it wasn't that bad.</P>

<P>The press had been full of tales of woe regarding the snow cover, but we were lucky, and soon after our arrival, there was <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val1.jpg">a great big drop</A> of the white stuff. It kept on for a couple of days and the winds kept the lifts closed. I wasn't too bothered, as I was holed up in the 'isolation ward'.</P>

<P>When we finally got on the slopes, there was <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val2.jpg">plenty of powder</A> to keep Alan happy. We got a few great off-piste runs in - this was <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val3.jpg">Andrew near the top of Danaides</A>. We also met up with some new folk at the chalet - this is Andrew and Alan, with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val4.jpg">Emily and Roger</A> as we find the powder on the way from Val d'Isere to Les Brevieres. </P>

<P>Of course it woudn't be a ski trip without plenty of mountain restaurant action. Have to say, I was a bit more partial to early morning stops than normal. You can see the last members of the team in this shot - <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val5.jpg">Fitz and Charlie</A>.</P>

<P>We were really lucky with the weather this day, but we heard in the evening that some folk were avalanched very close to where we were standing here at <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val6.jpg">Aiguille Perce</A>.</P>

<P>As always, the last day arrived, and as the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val7.jpg">cloud settled over Val</A>, I took the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/val8.jpg">little snowy trail</A> back to the chalet for the last time. I went to bed, coughed for 4 hours, then went out and beat Alan at table football.</P>

<P>Again.</P>
