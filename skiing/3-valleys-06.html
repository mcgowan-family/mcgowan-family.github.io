<P>Finally got to ski an area that so many folk had told me about. Was a big mixed group of 26 skiers and boarders staying in two chalets in Meribel Village between 3 and 11 Feb. There was some concern that the 'village' location, combined with a sparse snow cover might be a little remote, but it all <A HREF="../images/Skiing/stu-leffe.jpg">worked out well</A>.</P>

<P>We Eurostar'd from Waterloo, which led to great food, nice service, two extra days sking and a great night out in Moutiers before returning. I made the train with about 20 seconds to spare - don't think I trashed too many folk rushing through Waterloo with double ski bag! . The big group were in a Ski Basics chalet. Pretty decent, with really nice chalet staff. Chris, Shell, Pia, <A HREF="../images/Skiing/stu-loo.jpg">Stu</A>, Sarah and Garan stayed right next to the slopes in Fermes Meribel.</P>

<P>The easiest way up into the system was the Golf lift. Pretty cold in the morning, <A HREF="../images/Skiing/meri-lift.jpg">huddling for warmth</A> helped.There wasn't enough snow for much backcountry, but the pistes were in surprisingly good nick all over (best in Courchevel). First days were spent getting a grip on the geography by roaming all around from Courchevel 1650 in the east, right across to Orelle on the other side of Val Thoren. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/chris-plants.jpg">Chris</A> grabs a well-earned rest, while <A HREF="../images/Skiing/garan-pipe.jpg">Garan</A> dropped into the pipe. Shell grabbed a pic of me coming <A HREF="../images/Skiing/meri-jump.jpg">off the jump</A> above Mottaret (this pic was better than the one on landing :o)</P>

<P>Shell's boarding came on well during the week, with <A HREF="../images/Skiing/shell-edges.jpg">increasingly steeper slopes</A> benefitting from her <A HREF="../images/Skiing/shell-helmet.jpg">co-ordinated outfit</A>.</P>

<P>Night life in Meribel was pretty good. Lodge du Village (LdV) was the first stop straight off the Lapin run. After food, it was a strugggle to muster the energy, but some of us struggled through to the Tavern in Meribel proper. You can go <A HREF="../images/Skiing/ice-karting.jpg">ice-karting </A>on the Olympic rink - I'd recommend it :o)</P>

<P>I took the Wednesday off to go climbing in the back country. Set off from the top of the Cote Brune lift and climbed <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mont-dolent.jpg">Mont de Peclet</A>. The ridge got a lot more scrambly from that point. I dropped down onto the <A HREF="../images/Skiing/aiguille.jpg">Glacier du Borgne</A>, then crossed the Col du Borgne to descend a nasty slope into the Plan de Tueda. It turned into a long old day and I finally rocked into Mottaret at 7.</P>

<P>Every trip shuld have a competition. Worst outfit was the selected prize. The furry one could be an outright winner, but as he's obviously wearing it for a laugh it might be disqualified. You choose ....</P>

<P>We got a few centimetres of snow on the Thursday. I knew Andy wouldn't let me live it down if I hadn't at least had a look at the couloirs above Courchevel, so I decided that was the best day to work my way over there. The snow was a mixed blessing. Any snow is good, but 3 centimetres is just enough to cover the hazards, without cushioning you from them. Forgot camera, so no decent pic's of the runs. Did grand Couloir and Croix de Verdon. Latter was very impressive, with a 50m climb to start, then very edgy spot to put skis on. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/courcheval-couloirs.jpg">View from below</A> shows Grand on left and Croix de verdon on right.</P>

<P>The rest of the guys headed off Saturday morning, but me and Dom still had a whole day left and what a cracker. We decided to ski every resort and have something to eat or drink in every valley - just to stop us rushing too much :o) We headed up from Village to Col de la Loz above La Tania. Dropped from there down into Courchevel 1850 and across to 1650. The snow was great and we headed right over to the furthest east point before stopping at the gorgeous <A HREF="../images/Skiing/bel-air.jpg">Bel Air</A> restaurant for a well earned chocolat chaud and cake. We headed south and over the cols into Mottaret, up Plattiers, past Mont du Vallon and dropped down into Val Thoren for lunch at the creperie place. We were on sched and after lunch, whipped over the last col and down into Orelle for our last <A HREF="../images/Skiing/chocolat-chauds.jpg">chocolat chauds</A> of the trip. Very nice too :o) Back through Val Thorens, nipped down to Les Menuires and got a last look at <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mont-blanc.jpg">Mont Blanc</A> in the late afternooon sun before dropping down to Meribel 1450 and back to Village for a vin chaud in the LdV. About 70km in total!</P>

<P>Final treat was a fabulous meal in the Coq Rouge in Moutiers. This was a nice difference to the normal hassle of a long transfer to an airport and a good reason to take the Eurostar again. Definitely recommend it :o) Now looking forward to next ski outing on Haute Route in April.</P>
