<P>Well after all these years, it was finally going to happen. I was going to get to go skiing with my family. But not quite all of them. By this point we already knew that Sarah was pregnant with our third child, so we were keen not to jeopardize anything. But it was always going to be more of a winter holiday in the mountains - skiing, sledging, walking and lazy warm mornings in the chalet.</P>

<P>We had taken a lovely little flat in a really old chalet in the old vilage of Le Tour at the head of the valley. We were a five minute walk from the beginners slopes, so it was all very easy. Mornings were for the kids to do ski school. Then <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-1-0215.jpg">I'd give them a bit more tuition</a>.</P>

<P>The weather was glorious all week, so the <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-2-0215.jpg">views of the mountains</a> were superb and there was lots of time to <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-3-0215.jpg">just sit in the sun</a>. And lots of time <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-4-0215.jpg">for sledging</a>. </P>

<P>We headed down into <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-5-0215.jpg">Chamonix</a> for a wander round one afternoon. And on one morning, Sarah and me went for <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-6-0215.jpg">a great walk</a> along the Balcon Nord. Sarah <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-7-0215.jpg">enjoyed it in the end</a> (I think!!). And the views at <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-8-0215.jpg">Le Planet</a> were stunning. Meanwhile, the kids skiing was <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-9-0215.jpg">coming along nicely</a>.</P>

<P>By the Thursday, Bryher was up for a day off, but Patrick was so keen he was eating his breakfast <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-10-0215.jpg">in his ski gear</a>! So I decided to take him <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-11-0215.jpg">up the mountain</a>. He was nervous to begin with, but did really well going up <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-12-0215.jpg">his first tow</a>.</P>

<P>The weather was <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-13-0215.jpg">still gorgeous</a>, and we headed right to the top of the mountain. Patrick could <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-14-0215.jpg">hardly believe it</a>. <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-15-0215.jpg">Top of the world :)</a> And he earned himself <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-16-0215.jpg">a well deserved chocolat chaud</a> for his first red run!! Bryher really impressed the next day by getting her skis back on and <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-17-0215.jpg">getting back to it</a>.</P>

<P>On the last days skiing, Sarah and me took a hike up to <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-18-0215.jpg">the cascade above Le Buet</a>. The cascade was really impressive and <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-19-0215.jpg">mainly frozen</a>. Sarah did well to keep her nerve with <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-20-0215.jpg">the slippery trail</a>.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, back at L'ecole du Ski, it was <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-21-0215.jpg">graduation day</a>! Patrick and Bryher both passed out <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-22-0215.jpg">with flying colours</a> so it was back to L'Olympique for <a href="../images/Skiing/chamonix-23-0215.jpg">celebratory lunch</a>.</P>

<p>It was a fantastic week in the mountains. Unfortunately we had a bt of a nightmare return, due to the roads west of Geneva being blocked. I drove door to door for 20 hours. But all the memories above will be the ones that endure, and we'll hopefully be back on the slopes next season :)</p>
