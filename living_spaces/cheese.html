<P><B>late May Bank Holiday 2006</B></P>

<P>Doubtless you've all heard of the cheese rolling in Gloucestershire. But if you haven't taken the chance to find out why cider can damage your health, I encourage you to wander up to Coopers Hill on a May Bank Holiday and see what fermented apple juice can do to you.</P> 

<P>Every year, towards the end of May, <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers1-06.jpg">the few and the brave</A>, climb to the top of Coopers Hill in Gloucestershire to chase a cheese down a hill.</P>

<P>As you can see, <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers2-06.jpg">the cheese invariably wins</A>, but that doesn't stop <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers3-06.jpg">the girls</A> having a go.</P>

<P>This years ladies race turned into a southern hemisphere finale, with an Ozzie chasing down a fiery Kiwi into <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers5-06.jpg">the waiting arms </A>of the local rugby team.</P>

<P>They all get up <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers4-06.jpg">a fair pace</A>, and as you can see from this <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers6-06.jpg">high impact face plant</A> from the South Island amazon who claimed the Double Gloucester on this day, it's not something you always walk away from.</P>

<P>The day started off sunny, but there were a few heavy showers. The sensible folk had all worn <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/rollers7-06.jpg">appropriate headgear</A>.</P>

<P>Just as well I don't drink cider :o)</P>
