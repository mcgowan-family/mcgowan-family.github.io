<P>Knapp Road was bought in the housing peak of 1989 and sold in in the mid 2000's as my first marriage came to and end. We had moved back into Cheltenham from Washington, via Winchcombe, in 2003.</P>


<P>In that last year we had a week down in Lisbon, I can recommend the Metropole Hotel on <A HREF="../images/Iberia/lisbon_rossio.jpg">the Rossio</A>. Make sure you take a trip on <A HREF="../images/Iberia/lisbon_tram.jpg">one of the trams</A> through the Alfama district.</P>
