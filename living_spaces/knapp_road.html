<P>We moved back into Cheltenham town centre over Christmas. It has to be said that I'm happier with that state of affairs than Lin, who was quite happy living in the country, thank you!</P>

<P>Some of the benefits include having Waitrose as your corner store and Ski Tyres is just around the corner. Strangely, only I see the latter as a benefit.</P>

<P>What garden there is, <A HREF="../images/Cheltenham/knapp.jpg">is blooming</A>. Catch it while you can.</P>

<P>We had a week down in Portugal earlier in the month (Lisbon was fantastic, I can recommend the Metropole Hotel on <A HREF="../images/Iberia/lisbon_rossio.jpg">the Rossio</A>. Make sure you take a trip on <A HREF="../images/Iberia/lisbon_tram.jpg">one of the trams</A> through the Alfama district.</P>

<P>Trip to States and Canada went well. Yan organised a ride out in the woods - Cheers Matey! -and I finally bought a road bike.</P>
