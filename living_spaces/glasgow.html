<P><B>Spring 06</B></P>

<P>Popped up for a long weekend. Timing was based on seeing the UK premiere of <A HREF="http://www.thecollectivefilm.com/roam/index_roam.html"><I>Roam</I></A>. Movie was excellent. Place was rammed with what seemed to be every biker in Glasgow. Me and <A HREF="../images/Family/michael_paul_frank.jpg">Michael</A> now feeling very inspired to go and pump up the tyres at least :o)</P> 

<P><A HREF="../images/Glasgow/merchant-city-1.jpg">Glasgow was blooming</A>. Combination of hot temps, the Big Weekend and the <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/george-square-2.jpg">Scottish Cup Final</A>, gave the place <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/george-square-1.jpg">a carnival atmosphere</A>.</P>

<P>Went shopping for dresses with Shell and Ashleigh!!! <A HREF="../images/Family/michelles-dress.jpg">This wasn't the one</A> Shell bought. All the excitement was draining, so we decamped to <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/gandolfis.jpg">Gandolfis</A> for gorgeous lunch. <A HREF="http://www.cafegandolfi.com/">Gandolfis</A> has bumped Tisos for top lunch spot since The Cairn went all canteen-like.</P>

<P>Managed to make myself useful at Clochbar by laying some lawn. <A HREF="../images/Family/dad-lawn.jpg">The happy customer</A>, now wants to invest in some croquet lessons.</P>

<P><B>Background</B></P>

<P>Where I grew up and, in many ways, where I still think of as home. I always enjoy going back there; just wandering round the West End and town centre. Lunch at Tiso's is a must, getting a beer in a West End pub can't be missed and looking at the city from any of the hills to the North always feels good.</P>

<P>For folk that weren't lucky enough to grow up there, there's a lot to look at as well ;o) In recent years, they've made the most of the many Mackintosh assets that are scattered across the city. Have a wander up to <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/loggia.jpg">the Art College</A> in Garnet Hill (above Sauchiehall Street). Mackintosh designed the whole thing, so you'll recognise the iconic styles from the moment you <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/art-in.jpg">enter</A> to the moment you <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/school-out.jpg">leave</A>. If you sneak up to the top floor, there's a <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/mac-windows.jpg">great view</A> of the city.</P>

<P>The town centre retains a lot of mainly Victorian aspects. There are some great <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/horseshoe-bar.jpg">old boozers</A> and lots of the stores have retained the original features. <A HREF="../images/Glasgow/rsamd.jpg">This place</A> was the music and drama academy until recent years.</P>
