<P>Our place in Winchcombe was until recently the excellent Bell Inn - a Donnington's pub. It's just up from the High Street on the road over to Gretton. <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/locals.jpg">The locals</A> all seem very friendly, and we already seem to know more folk here than we did in Elko Drive.</P>

<P>Life consists of <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/salters_hill.jpg">country walks</A> and bike rides at the weekend. Wandering down to one of the local pubs - normally the White Lion - for <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/bibury.jpg">a beer of an evening</A>. Taking in a meal at one of the local restaurants - surprising amount of choice. And lots of work - too much - got to fix that.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/meadow.jpg">The Cotswolds in spring</A> and summer are amazing and the <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/bibury_terrace.jpg">contrast with life in the US</A> couldn't be greater.</P>

<P>Nigel's wedding to Carolyn went off very well. Turns out Nigel spins a neat circle on <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/nigel_carolyn.jpg">the dance floor</A> - hidden talents.</P>

<P>Did the Heart Foundation, <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/heart_foundation.jpg">Tour of the Cotswolds</A> bike tour. Not as exciting as Tour de Patapsco, but great atmosphere. As the new 'landlords' of the Bell Inn, we hosted the first beer on the traditional Donnington's Run. It covers about 80 miles and takes in each of the 16 <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/the_fox.jpg">Donnington pubs</A>, with <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/coach_and_horses.jpg">a beer in each</A> - "You'll ride it off", they said. Hmmmm.</P>

<P>Got a bit of <I>Parklife</I> in and went to 'the dogs' down at Swindon. Me and Steve went for the scientific approach and made the bookies very happy. <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/parklife.jpg">Lin and Jo</A> used the dog's name and how nice it looked and, of course, came out up.</P>
