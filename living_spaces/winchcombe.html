<P>On return from Washington, we transitioned through a place in Winchcombe that was until recently the excellent Bell Inn - a Donnington's pub. It's just up from the High Street on the road over to Gretton. <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/locals.jpg"></P>

<P>Life consisted of <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/salters_hill.jpg">country walks</A> and bike rides at the weekend. Wandering down to one of the local pubs - normally the White Lion - for <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/bibury.jpg">a beer of an evening</A>. Taking in a meal at one of the local restaurants - surprising amount of choice.</P>

<P><A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/meadow.jpg">The Cotswolds in spring</A> and summer were amazing and the <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/bibury_terrace.jpg">contrast with life in the US</A> couldn't be greater.</P>

<P>Nigel's wedding to Carolyn went off very well. Turns out Nigel spins a neat circle on <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/nigel_carolyn.jpg">the dance floor</A> - hidden talents.</P>

<P>Did the Heart Foundation, <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/heart_foundation.jpg">Tour of the Cotswolds</A> bike tour. Not as exciting as Tour de Patapsco, but great atmosphere. As the new 'landlords' of the Bell Inn, we hosted the first beer on the traditional Donnington's Run. It covers about 80 miles and takes in each of the 16 <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/the_fox.jpg">Donnington pubs</A>, with <A HREF="../images/Winchcombe/coach_and_horses.jpg">a beer in each</A> - "You'll ride it off", they said. Hmmmm.</P>
