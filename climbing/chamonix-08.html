<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Chamonix, July 2008</H1>
</DIV>


<P>I said last year that I was sure we'd be back to the <A HREF="http://www.gitevagabond.com/">Vagabond</A> and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-aiguilles.jpg">Chamonix</A> before too long. One year later ....</P>


<P>And we were <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-01.jpg">gathered in the car park</A> of the Grand Montets lift in Argentiere. We were in the Chamonix Valley for another weeks alpine climbing. Steve Green, Leo Crawford, Steve Cartwright and me.</P>

<P>The original plan for the first couple of days had been to take the lift to the top station, walk down to and across the Argentiere Glacier, stay at the Argentiere hut and then climb Aiguille Argentiere the next day via the Whymper Route. When we discovered that the lift was closed and the hut was being rebuilt, we decided to do the same route, but camp high on the glacier and do the whole route from the valley floor. More adventure, more ascent, more hard work.</P>

<P>We climbed quickly to the <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-02.jpg">Rognon Hut</A>. Great views of <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-03.jpg">Aiguille Chardonnet</A>. Route finding was hard work up the left flank of the glacier, but we finally made it to our planned <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-04.jpg">campsite</A> on the right flank of the glacier with <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-05.jpg">great views</A> all around the Argentiere basin.</P>

<P>Glaciers are amazing things. This '<A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-06.jpg">moulin</A>' is a sink hole where the water plunges straight down into the depths. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-07.jpg">Camping high</A> worked pretty well, with water accessible for <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-08.jpg">meals</A> near the edge of the glacier. As the sun started to set, the cliffs of <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-09.jpg">Les Droites</A> lit up pink and the <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-10.jpg">Aiguilles Rouge</A> were outlined in silhouette.</P>

<P>Next morning saw a 0300 start. We had scouted the complex base of the route the evening before and we hit it really well in the dark. A long climb up the Chardonnnet Glacier took us to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-11.jpg">the bergschrund</A> below the start of the climb proper around 0730. We opted for the fullest looking couloir, negotiated the bergschrund and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-12.jpg">made our way up</A> the long couloir. We emerged on to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-13.jpg">the shoulder</A> of the aigiulle above the north Saleina face and with Chardonnet in the background. A nice ascent above this northern face, took us to a fine snow crest, with <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-14.jpg">views of the summit</A>. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-15.jpg">We topped out</A> in good style and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-16.jpg">made our way  back</A> to the saddle. We were well behind guidebook time, so kept pushing on down a very steep slope above the Milieu Glacier. We finally made it back to the campsite around 1430 and then pushed on back down to the valley, finally reaching the carpark, <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-17.jpg">weary and worn</A> at 2000 - a full 17 hours after we started climbing that morning! </P>

<P>Bad weather kept us <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-18.jpg">in the valley</A> for a day. But we were soon back up high, this time at the Cosmiques hut, with plans for routes on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-19.jpg">the north face of Mont Blanc du Tacul</A>. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-21.jpg">As the sun went down</A>, there was <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-20.jpg">much discussion</A> about how avalanche prone the various options woud be after the considerable snow fall over the previous 2 days.</P>

<P>We got up early, but interestingly no-one else was heading towards any routes on Mont Blanc that day. We went over and had a long look at the Contamines-Grisolle route, but in the end decided not to go for it - it would still be there next year. After some <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-22.jpg">impromptu celebration</A> - <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-23.jpg">kids today</A> - we headed up to the Cosmiques ridge route.</P>

<P>Here's <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-24.jpg">Steve Cartwright</A> low down on the ridge. There is <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-25.jpg">one technical step</A>, and as we were the first rope up the ridge, it was chock full of ice for added interest. Route finding was tricky in parts, but we all made it safely to the top - this is <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-26.jpg">Steve Green and Leo at the top</A>.</P>

<P>Next morning we headed over to the Plan du Midi route. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-27.jpg">Fabulous views</A> unfolded across the Grands Jorasses and then further off to Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn. We planned to get as far along as time allowed and then double back to the Aiguille du Midi for a quick ride down in the cable car. Plan du Midi was great experience of high altitude ridge walking. This <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cham-08-28.jpg">Kraftwerk album</A> cover gives an idea of the terrain.</P>

<P>We covered about half the length of the ridge, before doubling back and safely returning to the Midi. As ever, it felt weird to make it back to the cramped confines of 'the indoors'. But we were soon back down in Cham and relaxing into a welcome cold glass of beer. Another great week, with more terrain and new experiences under our belt.</P>
