<P>A long weekend in the middle of February in the Fort William area. Always hit or miss with the weather. This time, we got lucky.</P>

<P>Cartwright, Raph, Leo and me headed up through the night on Thursday and, after <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-01.jpg">the inevitable faffing</a>,  started climbing on Aonach Eagach on the Friday morning. Conditions were amazing.</P>

<p>The climb to the ridge was amazing, with <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-02.jpg">stunning views</a> all around. Once on the ridge, it was just <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-03.jpg">one great little bit</a> of alpine ridge walking <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-04.jpg">after another</a>. With a few <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-07.jpg">fun wee gullies</a> thrown in. We made good time, despite <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-05.jpg">some mucking about</a> and although the descent <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-06.jpg">started off grea</a>t down to the pap, we were all wrecked by the time we got to the Clachaig.</p>

<P>Stayed at the hostel that night. 0530 start the next morning and headed up the tourist track, past the lochan and down into Corrie Leis. On reflection, I think the golf course track must be a lot quicker. We lost a lot of time and altitude dropping back down into the corrie. But had some fun <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-08.jpg">crossing a frozen burn</a>.</P>

<p>Conditions were superb again this morning. This picture has the whole of <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-09.jpg">Tower Ridge</a> in it, with the summit ridge visible with the morning light catching it. I had pretty much made up my mind that, given the conditions, we should go for Tower Ridge.</p>

<P>We started up the grade 2 gully at the bottom of TowerRidge at 1130. Way too late, but conditions were good and we could see that parties had cleared the route ahead. I started learning lessons immediately - where and how (or not) to pitch in steep snow; how long to lead out; keeping up communications. <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-10.jpg">Pitch after pitch</a>, with lots of simu-climbing brought us to <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-11.jpg">the Little Tower</a> and eventually to the bottom of the Great Tower, just as the light was starting to fade (so no more pictures I'm afraid). A fabulous traverse, made more sketchy by the darkness. This was starting to get a bit interesting.</P>


<P>I was climbing with Leo and Steve and Raph climbed on the other rope.</P>

<P>As I reached the end of the arete on Tower Gap, I was brought up short. I knew the Gap was the key to the tricky bit, I just hadn't expected it to be this tricky. Conditions were good, if very cold and time had marched on. I finally dropped off the end and Leo came over. We made good time up the rest of the ridge, but it was still around 2200 when we reached the top. Steve and Raph were a long way back and we could hear their calls on the rope. We got back off shortly after midnight and Steve and Raph staggered in a little after 3. <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-11-12.jpg">Bit of an epic</a> :o)</P>
