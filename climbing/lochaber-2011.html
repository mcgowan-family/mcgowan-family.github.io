<P>We made our now annual trip up North for a bit of Winter climbing. Lochaber again, due to a slightly better forecast. That was to turn out a little ironinc.</P>

<P>Big Dave came this time and we picked him up in Wetherby on the way through. As last year, we were in Glencoe by around 7. The weather was pretty closed in with cloud down around 2500. We decided to head up towards Stob Coire nan Lochan and do something easy to get folk into it. </P>

<p>Due to the poor conditions, we headed up a gully 50 meters left of our intended line. The going was straightforward, but the snow was deep and heavy and we took a fair while to get to <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-0211-01.jpg">the summit</a>. We ended up descending Easy Gully, which had been our intended route of ascent. The thing we went up was around grade 2 or 3.</p>

<P>The next day dawned, but that wasn't at all obvious through the gloom, cloud and rain. There would be no climbing today. Sarah had set me up with a great pancake mix, so I went at it in the kitchen and <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-0211-02.jpg">it all worked out very well</a>.</P>

<p>Later that day, we had a lovely walk up Glen Nevis above the gorge to <a href="../images/Climbing/lochaber-0211-03.jpg">Steal Falls</a>.</p>

<P>Conditions the next morning were a bit better and we headed up to Aonach Mor. The plan was to go over to the Eastern Cliffs. It was a white out as we hiked up from the middle station. The plan was to down climb Easy Gully, then go up something else. The gully was heavily corniced. After a bit of faffing, I dropped over the edge and went down onto a snow mushroom and made a dead man belay. Big Dave started down after me. I made a quick call based on size & experience of party and decided to call it off. There was too much fresh snow in the gully and it wasn't worth the risk. Still happy with the call in retrospect. The hill will be there next year, and so will we :)</P>
