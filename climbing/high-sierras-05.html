<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>High Sierras, September 2005</H1>
</DIV>


<P>Spent a couple of weeks in California with Fitz in Sep. We hiked and climbed in Yosemite, then went round to the Mount Whitney group in the eastern High Sierras.</P> 

<P>In Yosemite, we hiked the <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/sentinel.jpg">the south rim</A> of the valley. We combined the 4 Mile Trail, <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/half-dome-and-falls.jpg">Panorama Trail</A> and Nevada & <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/vernal.jpg">Vernal Falls</A> Trails to make a big first day. Second day in the valley was spent <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/oak-tree-flake.jpg">climbing on the local wall</A> to Camp 4 (Swan Slabs). It's tiny by Yosemite standards, but hey, it was still Yosemite :o) </P>

<P>We took a great trip round to Tuolumne Meadows on the tour bus. The driver - Charles - was a riot. Definitely worth doing. We hiked from Tenaya Lake to Sunrise Creek via the summmit of Clouds Rest (roughly 9 500 feet). The <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/half-dome.jpg">view of Half Dome</A> and the Valley from Clouds Rest is awesome. We summitted on <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/half-dome-summit.jpg">Half Dome</A> that evening which gave a real sense of achievement. The views of <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/clouds-rest.jpg">Clouds Rest</A> and <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/merced.jpg">the Merced group</A> in the evening light were great. Back to camp, made a great fire and sat chatting to 3 girls from Washinton State all night before turning in. Next morning we headed back down to <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/el-cap.jpg">the valley</A> (early morning sun on <A HREF="../images/Yosemite/grub-grub.jpg">grub gnawed tree</A>), picked up the car and drove round to Bishop. </P>

<P>We headed down to Lone Pine (the entry point for Mount Whitney) the next day. Things got a bit wild at this point. It transpires that there are only 10 permits a day for back country camping around Mount Whitney. 6 of those are raffled off 6 months before the date of entry (Feb in this case). The other 4 are allocated to walk-ins on the day. If more than 4 folk want to go in, then it goes to a lottery. It went to a lottery for us on the day, but the luck held and we got a pass :o) Lesson being, if you want to do Whiitney by anything other than the Normal Route - book ahead.</P>

<P>We were well acclimated for the attempt on Whitney. The weather forecast was good, so we were feeling pretty positive. All went to plan. We <A HREF="../images/Whitney/below-iceberg.jpg">ascended to Iceberg Lake</A>, via the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek. We crossed the infamous <A HREF="../images/Whitney/eckers-ledges.jpg">Ebersbachers Ledges</A> without incident. We had met a good few climbers in the hikers camp at Whitney Portal, and we made the ascent with 2 of them George Bell and Warren Teissier  from Colorado).  George wrote <a href="http://www.gibell.net/trip_reports/WhitneyEastFace05.html">a nice description of their ascent</a>. One of the other pairs that had lost out on the lottery, attempted the East Buttress in a day from the Portal.  A massive effort that must have wrecked them, but they'd travelled down from Oregon, so they weren't going to miss out.</P>
    
<P>A girl had taken a fall on the Mountaineers Route that day. She fell at 11AM, gave herself a compound fracture of the ankle and it was 7PM before <A HREF="../images/Whitney/heli-rescue.jpg">the heli</A> finally managed to get close enough to lift her out. Must have been a horrible day.</P>

<P>The next morning was a glorious day. <A HREF="../images/Whitney/russell-iceberg.jpg">Mount Russell</A> was reflected in Iceberg, the <A HREF="../images/Whitney/whitney-first-light.jpg">summit of Whitney</A> was clear and the <A HREF="../images/Whitney/mountaineers-route.jpg">Mountaineer's Route</A> was clearly visible and pretty much clear of snow. We set off just after 8 and <A HREF="../images/Whitney/whitney-summit.jpg">summitted</A> around 10. The route is straightforward, with the best rock reserved for the final 50 feet if you keep left at the top of the summit gully. We had decided to go on to do Mount Muir. It turned out to be a great little climb. Really windy on top, with just enough room for <A HREF="../images/Whitney/muir.jpg">one at a time</A>.</P>

<P>That night we dropped down to a lower camp at 11 500 by Upper Boy Scout Lake. It was just as well, as the weather finally broke and the snow and rain came in with a vengeance. This meant that Mount Russell was now out of the question, but no bad thing as we were seriously in need of a wash. The big news on getting back was that the Hibees had gone down 1-0 to Celtic at Easter Road. The news unsettled Paul's mental state and led to some <A HREF="../images/USA/fitz-fashion.jpg">very unusual behaviour</A>. Just as well we were heading to San Francisco.</P>
