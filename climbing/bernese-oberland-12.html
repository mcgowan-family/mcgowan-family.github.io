<P>5 years since I'd been in Switzerland and 4 years since I'd been to the Alps at all. I wasn't really missing it, but a couple of chance conversations got me thinking that I might quite enjoy popping back over for a few hills :)</P>


<P> A few quick mails and we had the germ of an idea. <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-15.jpg">Dave Forman, Dave Asbridge and me</a> would head to Grindelwald, head east up the Grindelwald glacier to the Schreckhorn Hut and do a couple of mountains from there.</P>

<P>We wouldn't be a strong climbing team, so we'd need to gear the target mountains with that in mind. But we were determined to get on top of something, and that's just what we did.</P>

<P>The travel logistics worked well. National Express to Heathrow early Thursday morning, Swiss Air to Zurich and a Swiss Travel Pass to Grindelwald on the trains. We met Dave at Bern and it was great to see him again. We were in Grindelwald by lunchtime, and were sitting having lunch below the Mittellegi Ridge shortly after. Nice picnic Dave!</P>

<p>There was a nasty looking accident just above our lunch stop. Hopefully the walker made a good recovery once they got off the mountain. We carried on up above the Baregg Restaurant, <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-11.jpg">last views back towards Grindelwald</a> with Eiger, Monch and Fiescherhorn, then through the Rots Gufer area which hangs above the glacier and got to the hut at 1900.</P>

<P>Some comment has to be made about the guardian at <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-09.jpg">the Schreckhorn Hut</a>. Dinner was served at 1830. Not 1800, not 1900, but 1830 - and we arrived at 1900. He wasn't happy. A mountain farce followed, where we played the hapless, Brit climbers with poor language skills but cheery dispositions; and the guardian played a fabulously grumpy Swiss German who gradually warms to us over the course of the evening and ends up showing us the sneeky way to get the lights to work in the morning. </P>

<P>He wasn't happy about my proposed target for the second day either. He made it very clear that there was no way we were going to safely get to the summit of the Finsteraarhorn and back from his hut. This was backed up by the fact that no one in the hut logbook had tried it that year. The only record we found of such an attempt involved a fatal accident. So much for gearing our route accordingly. I decided to replan.</P>

<P>We set off at 0530 the next morning just before first light. We dropped onto the glacier and made our way to the old Strahlegg Hut. We were thrilled to come across a group of <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-02.jpg">Alpine Ibex</a> and amazed when two of the males had an impromptu bout of head butting right in front of us! <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-03.jpg">The sun was up </a>on the Finsteraarhorn by now,</P>

<P>We made our way  eastwards from there, in a rising traverse and cut into the cwm just above point 2922. Dave got a nice <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-12.jpg">mirror lake</a> shot. Donning crampons, we headed up and eventually came to the ridge at point 3474. From there it was a reasonably straightforward ascent to <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-04.jpg">the summit</a>.</P>

<P>One of the great things about the Strahlegghorn, was that we were the only ones on the mountain. Everyone else was over on the Schreckhorn and <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-13.jpg">Lauteraarhorn</a>.  And it felt more of an adventure as a consequence. The views form the summit <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-14.jpg">in every direction</a> were amazing.</P>

<P>The descent to the Strahlegg Pass was considerably more technical than the ascent we had made, so we roped up. There was no need to pitch the routes, so we  simu-climbed and flipped the rope over natural protection.</P>

<p><a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-16.jpg">The descent worked well</a> and we rejoined our line of ascent at the ruins of the old Strahlegg Hut. A short walk <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-17.jpg">back over the glacier</a> and a tiring climb back to the hut brought us back around 1700.</p>

<p>The food was great at the hut all weekend and we made light work of it, before sorting our bags for the morning and hitting the sack.</p>

<p>We had decided to go for the Kleine Schreckhorn as our second mountain of the weekend. It was even less climbed than the Strahlegghorn. There was a very brief route description and I'd recce'd the start the evening before to make it easier in the morning darkness.</p>

<p>The route ascends in a steeply climbing diagonal on the west side of the Schwarzzegg ridge. The formal route ascends onto the Nassi Glacier, but it had retreated enough to reveal a 10 metre area directly in front of the nose that afforded a route through onto the easier ground of the glacier beyond. <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-05.jpg">We opted for that</a> as it avoided the ice fall above, but conscious of the fact that it would be in full sun on our return route and subject to ice and rock fall.</p>

<p><a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-06.jpg">The climb up the Nassi was steep</a> and didn't afford many obvious rest stops. It also wasn't at all obvious where the summit was. The Nassihorn was obvious but due to the extreme steepness,  the Little Schreckhorn was hidden from sight.  We followed the route and eventually it became clear where the summit ridge was.</p>

<p>After some rough scrambling over scree, <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-07.jpg">we gained the ridge</a>, but a couple of hundred metres east of the true col. We made our way along the ridge (PD - AD) to the col. Progress was slow as I was belaying the trickier steps and it was 1230 when we reached the col.</p>

<p>The snow in the coulior below us was now soft, and the route ahead to the summit 100 meters above was going to be as slow as the ridge had been, so the right decision had to be descent from that point. We made our way carefully down, back over the bergschrund and retraced our steps down the glacier to the tricky crossing in front of the nose.</p>

<p>As expected there was now a rock fall hazard, but thankfully not as bad as it could have been. Still roped, we donned helmets and did one across the face. Safely on the other side, we degeared and dropped back down our orignal route. A real treat was to see two Chamois bounce along below us on the hill, before getting <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-08.jpg">back to the hut at sunset</a>..</p>

<p>The Kleine Schreckhorn will be there next year, and <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-18.jpg">we had all had a great time </a>and, as ever, learned a lot. Our prep had been good, the rope work was great and we were pretty close to guide time on both routes. So it was with great satisfaction that we descended back out of the land of glaciers and down to the valley.</p>

<p>Dave had one last treat in store when we managed to make the boat to travel back from Interlaken to Thun on the Thunersee. As <a href="../images/Climbing/grindelwald-0812-10.jpg">we swept in style along the lake</a>, the views back to the mountains gradually opened up and we could see the Kleine Schreckhorn and all the ground we had covered over the weekend.</p>

<p>A hasty cheerio to Dave A in Bern and then me and Dave F got back to Zurich Flughafen. The only travel glitch was a missed bus back in Heathrow, so it was a later than planned return to Cheltenham on Sunday night.</p>

<p>It is amazing what you can do in a weekend when you put your mind to it :)</p>
