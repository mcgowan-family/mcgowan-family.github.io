<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Northern Corries, Cairngorm, Feb 06</H1>
</DIV>

<P>Headed up to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/northern-corries-walkin.jpg">northern corries</A> of Cairngorm with Raph. I'd tried to get ice climbing up here a couple of times before, but conditions always defeated us. We were better prepared than ever (i.e. we had axes) but again conditions seemed to be against us.</P>

<P>We headed up into Corrie an t-Sneachda on the first day and found a couple of the lowest graded routes with some ice. There was a party of 4 roped up in <A HREF="../images/Climbing/alladins-couloir.jpg">Alladin's Couloir</A> (1 *), so we thought we'd go up and watch them. Having been told there was nothinng going, we had only taken an axe each, but we had a look and decided to work our way up the ice by using the rock on the right of the first pitch. It turned into a nice little first climb for both of us.</P>


<P>Day 2 saw conditions improve a little. There was still little ice, but some more snow had come down. We decided to go to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/sneachda.jpg">Sneachda</A> again with the plan of doing Red Gully (2 **). Another party was gearing up for that, so we switched to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/runnel1.jpg">The Runnel</A> (2 *) which is the central and most direct line of the Trident Gullies. It was a clear step up from the first climb in terms of steepness. The top pitch was a chimney and I was glad to clear the top in the very thin conditions (this is <A HREF="../images/Climbing/runnel2.jpg">Raph topping out</A>). The availability of gear suited the minimalist approach we had adopted, although Raph did have a few words to say about a certain 'nubbin' placement.</P>

<P>Day 3, and we decided to up the stakes again. Headed across to Hell's Lum Crag and did the Lum (2/3 ***). It feels very remote when you've hiked across the top of the plateau to get there. It was a wild day on top and no one else was making the trek, so we had the crag to ourselves. Climbed up to the <A HREF="../images/Climbing/hells-lum-1.jpg">bottom of the first pitch</A> to gear up (Lesson: gear up before climbing!!). Again there was more snow, but not a lot of ice. The first pitch involved some back stepping to gain ground. Second pitch was steep snow. Third pitch was a nice ice wall on the left of the waterfall and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/hells-lum-2.jpg">final pitch</A> was steep snow. It felt very good to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/hells-lum-3.jpg">top out</A> :o)</P>


<P>On day 4  we did some hill walking above the <A HREF="../images/Climbing/lairig-ghru.jpg">Lairig Ghru</A>. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/sgoran-dubh-mor.jpg">Fabulous conditions </A>and we even managed a steep little snow descent back down into the pass after summiting on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/sron-na-lairig.jpg">Sron na Lairig</A>.</P>

<P>It was a fabulous week's climbing and it felt great to finally get some ice in. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cairngorm.jpg">Walking off Cairngorm</A> , there was a clear sense that we'd be back.</P>
