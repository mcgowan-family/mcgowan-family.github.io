<DIV ALIGN="center"><H1>Chamonix, July 2007</H1>
</DIV>

<P>This summer's Alpine extravaganza was centred on the Chamonix Valley. Leo had a target of summitting on Mont Blanc and the trip took shape around that. The team this year was <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-cosmique3.jpg">Leo, Raph, Dave Asbridge, Steve Cartwright</A> and me. We did lots of prep with the standard training on rope work, crevasse rescue and nav. The residents around Montpellier Gardens looked a little alarmed when we descended on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-bandstand.jpg">the bandstand</A> complete with ropes, pulleys and serious intent. No lasting damage done though.</P>

<P>For the first time, we decided to drive down to the Alps, which gave us great flexibility in what gear we took, how we got there and putting other options in once we got down to the valley should the weather prove unhelpful in that local area.</P>

<P>As it turned out, the weather was much less helpful in the area of Gloucestershire. The <A HREF="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/floods/">100 year storm</A> hit and the guys had a hell of a time getting out of the county and down to the south east. I was in London, so was less affected, but by the time we met in Kent, our ship had sailed. Salvation was at hand in the form of the Channel Tunnel, the rest of the trip down went as planned and we rocked up in Chamonix on the morning of 20 July.</P>

<P>Leo had stumbled across a great place to stay called <A HREF="http://www.gitevagabond.com/">Gite Vagabond</A>, and we'll doubtless use this place again. Great bar, nice rooms and a good drying room!</P>

<P>We used a couple of key books. For general alpine routes, <A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mont-Blanc-Range-Guidebook-Reflecting/dp/1898573727">this one</A> was a source of excellent info. Routes described were at just the right level (PD to TD) to be within reach, and covered all the mountains in the massif. The <A HREF="http://store.everestgear.com/mge037.html">other book</A> related more to Mont Blanc and covered the 5 main lines of ascent.</P>

<P>We had a week in the valley, but we wanted to get straight into practicing snow, rock and ice techniques as soon as possible and get some altitude in, so we headed up to Argentiere and took <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-grands-montets.jpg">the Grands Montets</A> lift up to the Petit Verte. This turned out to be a great one to start on as it was a relatively short ascent from the cable car up to the summit, but it was long enough and technical enough, to allow us to practice most of the main techniques of moving together on a rope, ice axe arrest, moving together, and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-petit-verte2.jpg">short pitching on rock</A>. It was also a good try out for some of the <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-beanie.jpg">more technical items</A> of gear. It was a <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-verte.jpg">great little summit</A> and gave a <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-petit-verte.jpg">nice sense of exposure</A> at some points - even if Raph can't remember them.</P>

<P>Next day saw us head back up the valley, beyond Argentiere, to Le Tour. It was a really warm day so we stripped our gear down to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-tour.jpg">the bare essentials</A>. From here, a quick hike up, took us to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-albert.jpg">the Albert Premier Refuge</A>. Nice views of the Tour Glacier on the way up, but the excellent weather of the day before was giving way to some stormier conditions.</P>

<P> Our plan had been to summit on Aiguille Tour the next day. The hut guardian sensibly stopped anyone setting out early by refusing to serve breakfast - good technique that. Conditions began to relent around 6 and all the parties headed out. More good practice for us and good altitude training, but by the time we reached around 3 200m, conditions had deteriorated and the trend appeared to be getting worse. We decided to head back into the valley as it seemed unlikely we'd summit and I needed to get back to Geneva to catch a flight home to look after Sarah for a bit. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-snowman.jpg">It wasn't just the Alps</A> that got hit with some poor weather, as this was the week the water crisis hit Gloucestershire.</P>

<P>Two days at altitude and one night so far. All good prep. That night, the guys stayed at the Vagabond again and we heard that a team of 4, including a British climber, had died on the Gouter Route of Mont Blanc. They had been caught out in the same weather that had affected us on Aiguille Tour.</P>

<P>Next day the guys headed up to Aiguille Midi and then down to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-cosmique4.jpg">the Cosmiques Refuge</A>. Next morning saw them carry on with the plan and climb the excellent <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-cosmique2.jpg">Cosmiques Arete</A>. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-cosmique.jpg">A great day out</A> in excellent conditions.</P>

<P>Conditions were perfect the next day for a summit ascent to Mont Blanc, so the team headed up over the Trois Mont route and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-summit.jpg">successfully summitted</A>! Raph had been badly affected by altitude, but was able to make a solo ascent of Mont Blanc du Tacul. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-satis.jpg">Lots of satisfaction</A> all around :o)</P>

<P>So all the main targets were achieved, which was a great achievement. The training beforehand paid off and everyone felt comfortable with the alpine style of climbing. Dave and Steve even managed to get in some biking, which Steve seemed  to particularly enjoy. Apparently Leo and Raph went to the bar. Again :o)</P>

<P>I'm sure we'll be back to the Vagabond and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mont-blanc-07-aiguilles.jpg">Chamonix</A> before too long.</P>
