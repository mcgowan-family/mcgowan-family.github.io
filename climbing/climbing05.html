<P><B>December</B></P>

<P>Got back up North at end of the year and did some stuff outdoors with Fitz around <A HREF="../images/Climbing/kingy-05.jpg">Glencoe</A>. Finally got into the Ice Factor at Kinlochleven and knocked lumps out of the ice wall. Picked up a bivvy bag and tested it out down to -10 on Rannoch Moor. Pleased to say it performed well. Got over to <A HREF="../images/Climbing/fitz-liam-ratho.jpg">Ratho</A> with Fitz and Liam and did some <A HREF="../images/Climbing/mcg-ratho-05.jpg">great routes</A>.</P>


<P><B>September</B></P>

<P>Most of the month has been consumed by the <A HREF="high-sierras-05.html">High Sierras trip</A>.</P>


<P><B>August</B></P>

<P>Last minute preps in the first weeks of the month led up to <A HREF="arolla-05.html">the big trip to Arolla</A> to try and do a decent route in the Alps.</P>


<P><B>July</B></P>

<P>Headed up to Skye last weekend. Weather wasn't quite as balmy as in Chelt, but had excellent time up in Corrie Ghrunnda and on Ridge with young Michael. Great views of <A HREF="../images/Climbing/eilan-donan.jpg">Eilean Donan</A> on way up, Glen Brittle campsite was perfect and midges weren't bad at all. Good experience of what early stages of hypothermia feels like, but 30 min's in the shower helped a lot. Audi wagon is perfect for these trips, but not sure how I'd get <A HREF="../images/Climbing/road-trip-05.jpg">all of this</A> into a couple of panniers.</P>

<P>We put up a couple of new routes on Cleeve Hill last night!! We climbed on the crag along from Castle Rock that we've been using for crevasse rescue. Turns out to be really good rock. Obviously been climbed before as there's a stake above it for top-roping. Not in the guide but excellent climbing and good to do something new up there. Both routes went at around HS or VS.</P>

<P><B>June</B></P>

<P>In addition to planning a few day trips in the UK (look out for The Cuillin in July), we're starting to get a bit excited about the Alps in August. We headed up to Cleeve Hill and started doing some roped glacier training and crevasse rescue. It had been a while for all of us, so there was a fair bit of, "<A HREF="../images/Climbing/self-rescue-1.jpg">So this rope goes through here ... right??</A>". Everyone agreed that I should be <A HREF="../images/Climbing/self-rescue-2.jpg">first over the cliff</A> (Why am I always first over the cliff? I can't see this ending well). It was <A HREF="../images/Climbing/self-rescue-3.jpg">a stunning evening</A> and, as luck would have it, we all agreed that a pint in The Rising Sun made sense :o)</P>



<P><B>May</B></P>

<P>Amazing day trip to Roaches towards end of the month. Everything came together - from the weather, to the bacon & egg oatcakes and finished off with a great pub meal. Oh yeah, the climbing was pretty special too. Alan, Adrian, Jade, Steve, Rose and me made up the party. We climbed all day and it was amazing to get back on grit again. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/steve-jade-roaches.jpg">Jade leads up</A> while Steve minds the rope. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/jade-valkyrie.jpg">Jade reaches</A> on Valkyrie.</P>

<P>First outdoor evening for most folk on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/cleeve-may05.jpg">Cleeve</A>.</P>




<P><B>April</B></P>
<P>Lots of indoor climbing at the wall in Gloucester but nothing outside yet. Manage to get to the wall at Govan when I'm up in Glasgow and Michael, <A HREF="../images/Climbing/geraldine-jammin.jpg">Geraldine</A>, <A HREF="../images/Climbing/ash-hanging.jpg">Ashleigh</A> and Michelle have started going regularly as well. Geraldine and Michelle watch Ashleigh on <A HREF="../images/Climbing/ash-pink.jpg">the pink overhang</A> - what is it about girls and pink!</P>



<P><B>March</B></P>
<P>The randonee ski setup is getting me back onto mountain tops by a different route. Did 4 peaks in Colorado and Utah on the skis. <A HREF="../images/Skiing/CB-4.jpg">Mount Emmons</A> at Crested Butte was the best climb and most distinctive peak. Set off from trailhead around 9 000 and traversed the hill from south to north. Summit was 12 392 and <A HREF="../images/Skiing/mt-emmons-west.jpg">the surroundings</A> had a nice high altitude feel. Skied off the west face and dropped down into <A HREF="../images/Skiing/slate-river.jpg">the Slate River basin</A>. Hitched out from there back to CB town.</P>

<P><B>Sun 6 Feb</B></P>
<P>Julian arranged accommodation above <A HREF="../images/Climbing/rydall.jpg">Rydall Water</A>. Went <A HREF="../biking/biking_UK_05.html">biking</A> in Grizedale on the Saturday and on Sunday we headed up to Pinnacle Ridge from Patterdale. <A HREF="../images/Climbing/pinnacle-prep-feb05.jpg">Got our stuff together</A> at the base of the ridge and set off up the <A HREF="../images/Climbing/pinnacle-progress-feb05.jpg">sloping slabs</A> and blocks. There is <A HREF="../images/Climbing/pinnacle-rose-feb05.jpg">one technical section</A>, but even in greasy conditions we all made light work of it. It was a long hike back above Deep Dale and <A HREF="../images/Climbing/st%20sundays%20feb05.jpg">a grand day out </A>on the hills.</P>
