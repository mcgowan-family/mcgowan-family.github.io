<P><B>What is it?</B></P>
<P>Challenger World is an annual competition that aims to build great corporate teams by testing the many entrants over a few days of arduous physical and mental stages.  <A HREF="http://www.challengerworld.com/">Find out all about it</A>.  We put a few teams in each year and generally do pretty well.</P>

<P>This year, we did <A HREF="../images/Challenger/beer-not-just-for-breakfast.jpg">a little bit bettter</A> than normally.</P>

<P><B>Challenger 05</B></P>

<P><B>Challenger Worlds 2005</B></P>

<P>This years event took place at Crystal river in Florida, USA.</P>

<P>There were only 5 stages over 3 days, so the endurance aspects were much less serious than UK Challenger. The quality of the competition had gone up as expected. Stage 1 was a timed-gate orienteering stage through forest land and<A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage1-05.jpg"> the guys</A> did a great job keeping us in contention (I sat this one out). <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage2-05-start.jpg">Stage 2</A> was an engineering stage and for once <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage2-05-bales.jpg">we did pretty well</A>. Stage 3 was a night stage with orienteering and logic problems, Again we did well to leave ourselves in second place with more than half the contest behind us.</P>

<P>Day 2 turned out far less well. The penultimate stage had harsh penalties for not coming in the first few teams. Despite <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage4-05.jpg">a big physical effort,</A> we finished well out of the places. This put us out of the contest and the last stage was something of a blur. It was a sad end to a great year in Challenger, but such is the nature of contests. A better team won on the day.</P>

<P>The contest closed with a party on the Saturday night. For some, the exertions had clearly been <A HREF="../images/Challenger/party-05.jpg">too much</A> ;o)</P>


<P><B>Challenger Ball 2005</B></P>

<P>In order to raise cash for the Worlds charity (<A HREF="http://www.dreamflight.org/">Dreamflight</A>), we organised a Charity Ball, held at the <A HREF="http://www.thedaffodil.co.uk/">Daffodil</A> in Cheltenham. It was a sparkling affair, with a great band, brilliant setting and successful auction of promises. Garan laid on the Jersey Cow, I blagged some auction prizes, Chris got way over the odds for them and Ali organised it all.</P>

<P>It wouldn't be fair on <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-ian-mark.jpg">lots of drunk people</A> to bring you all the pictures, but here are a few. <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-flat.jpg">A bunch of us</A> met up at Clare Mews, then headed round to The Daffodil. Everyone was looking <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-crispin-susan.jpg">very smart</A>, even <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-jos.jpg">the boys</A>. Everyone seemed to have <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-guest-of-mark-hopwood.jpg">a good time</A> and it all got <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-andy-john.jpg">a bit lairy</A> on the dance floor. We even <A HREF="../images/Challenger/ball-05-andy-dawn.jpg">left them smiling</A> at the end.</P>

<P><B>8 - 12 June</B></P>

<P>The time had finally come for the event. Chris turned up bang on time ;o) and we all headed west. The event was taking place in the hills east of Aberystwyth and it didn't take long to get going with the first event being a night run through the woods on the Wednesday evening.</P>

<P>The details of the various stages can be found on the <A HREF="http://www.challengerworldresults.com/results.php?viewevent=16">Challenger site</A> so I won't go into all that. Suffice to say, we started well and didn't look back. <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage2-group.jpg">The three HQ teams</A> were co-located, so we were able to give each other moral support throughout. One of the best stages was a whole day event and these pic's were of <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage5-007.jpg">007</A> and <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage5-008.jpg">008</A> heading down there.</P>

<P>We moved steadily up the table until the last evening when we moved into first place. We were always pretty serious about it, but <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage7-rob.jpg">we were full on</A> for this night stage. </P>

<P>That night, we were all surprised by the news that <A HREF="../images/Challenger/stage7-ubb.jpg">Usama bin Bob</A> had been tracked down to his mountain hideout above Devil's Bridge!!</P>

<P>Charlie and Garan did great work coming up with a winning strategy for 'Off the Board' the next day and we beat all our closest rivals. This put us in a virtually unassailable position going into the last stage.</P>

<P>At the end of the event, 007 crossed the line in 1st place. 008 did an amazing job coming 12th as a novice team and with a reduced number of fit team members and <A HREF="../images/Challenger/finish-009.jpg">009</A> hit their target of getting into the top 100.</P>

<P>It  was a brilliant competition with a lot of very competitive teams who pushed us hard thoughout. There's masses of enthusiasm for getting involved next year. There's lots of talk of multi-ability, mixed and a girls team. We've got a trophy to defend and <A HREF="../images/Challenger/result.jpg">it just doesn't get much better than this</A>.</P>

<P>Needless to say, training for next year <A HREF="../images/Challenger/beer-not-just-for-breakfast.jpg">has already begun</A>. So watch this space!!</P>

<P>Towards the end of the month we got down on the Wye for some canoe training. Everyone had a good day and the weather was kind. <A HREF="../images/Challenger/wye1.jpg">Garan seemed keen to get off</A> on a regular basis, Rachael made sure she did <A HREF="../images/Challenger/wye3.jpg">her fair share</A> and Rhiannon <A HREF="../images/Challenger/wye2.jpg">steered their craft</A> away from troubled waters.</P>


<P>Another great Challenger day out in the FoD. Ian and Andy came along and made sure everyone had a good time. Once again we all got some air ...</P>

<P>At start of month, went on training weekend in Cambrian Mountains in Wales. There's no easy explanation for <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-andys-forked.jpg">some of these pictures</A>, and it's not always clear what <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-scary-garan.jpg">the link</A> to Challenger is, but everyone seemed to be having <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-goes-postal.jpg">a good time</A> :o) And <A HREF="../images/Pals/chal-road-trip.jpg">despite appearances</A>, it wasn't taken too seriously.</P>

<P><B>April</B></P>


<P>Great Challenger day out in the FoD. Ian and Crispin came along to make sure we didn't lose anyone (cheers guys!). Chris made sure we <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod0.jpg">all got there on time</A>, the rental folk could tell not everyone had done this before, "<A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod1.jpg">This, is a bike</A>", but <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod2.jpg">we all stuck together</A>, we all got <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod3.jpg">some air</A> and we all got very, <A HREF="../images/Biking/challenger-fod4.jpg">very muddy</A> :o) </P>
